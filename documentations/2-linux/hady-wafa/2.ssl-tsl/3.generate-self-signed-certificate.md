# SSL Cert

## Secure EC2 Instance

To use AWS Certificate Manager (ACM) for securing your website with a public SSL/TLS certificate, you need to follow these steps. However, it's important to note that ACM's free public certificates can only be directly used with certain AWS services like Elastic Load Balancing, CloudFront, API Gateway, etc. If you are using a plain EC2 instance, you will need to use a different approach. Here's a detailed explanation:

### Using Let’s Encrypt for SSL/TLS Certificates

1. **Connect to Your EC2 Instance**:

   - SSH into your EC2 instance.

2. **Install Certbot**:

   - Certbot is a tool that automates the process of obtaining and renewing Let's Encrypt certificates.
   - Depending on your operating system, the installation steps vary. Here’s an example for Ubuntu:

     ```bash
     sudo apt update
     sudo apt install certbot python3-certbot-nginx
     ```

3. **Obtain and Install a Certificate**:

   - If you are using Nginx as your web server, you can use Certbot to automatically configure SSL:

     ```bash
     sudo certbot --nginx -d hadywafa.com -d www.hadywafa.com
     ```

   - Follow the prompts to complete the process.

4. **Renew Certificates Automatically**:

   - Let’s Encrypt certificates are valid for 90 days. Certbot can automatically renew them.
   - To set up automatic renewal, you can create a cron job:

     ```bash
     sudo crontab -e
     ```

   - Add the following line to the crontab to run the renewal command twice a day:

     ```bash
     0 0,12 * * * /usr/bin/certbot renew --quiet
     ```

### Using ACM Certificates (Indirect Method)

If you still want to use ACM certificates, you would need to integrate with an AWS service that supports ACM certificates:

1. **Elastic Load Balancer (ELB)**:

   - Create an Application Load Balancer (ALB) and configure it to use your ACM certificate.
   - Point your domain to the load balancer instead of the EC2 instance.
   - Forward traffic from the load balancer to your EC2 instance.

2. **CloudFront**:
   - Create a CloudFront distribution with your EC2 instance as the origin.
   - Configure CloudFront to use the ACM certificate.
   - Update your DNS to point to the CloudFront distribution.

### Summary

- **Direct Use of ACM Certificates**: Not possible directly on an EC2 instance without using another AWS service.
- **Alternative - Let's Encrypt**: A free and popular option for obtaining SSL/TLS certificates that can be installed directly on your EC2 instance.
- **Indirect Use of ACM Certificates**: Use AWS services like ELB or CloudFront that support ACM certificates and route traffic to your EC2 instance.
