# How SSH Uses Private Keys to Connect to AWS EC2 Instances

When you use SSH to connect to a server, including an AWS EC2 instance, the SSH client automatically uses the private key that you specify in the command or that is associated with the connection. If you don't explicitly specify a private key, SSH looks for a default private key in your `~/.ssh` directory.

## How SSH Finds the Private Key

### 1. **Specifying a Private Key in the Command:**

- You can explicitly specify the private key to use with the `-i` option when running the `ssh` command.

  ```bash
  ssh -i /path/to/your/private-key.pem ec2-user@your-ec2-instance-public-dns
  ```

- In this example, `/path/to/your/private-key.pem` is the path to your private key file, and `ec2-user@your-ec2-instance-public-dns` is the user and server you're connecting to.

### 2. **Default Private Key Location:**

- If you don't specify a private key with the `-i` option, the SSH client looks for a private key in the default location, which is the `~/.ssh` directory on your local machine.
- Common filenames that SSH looks for by default are:
  - `~/.ssh/id_rsa`
  - `~/.ssh/id_ecdsa`
  - `~/.ssh/id_ed25519`
  - `~/.ssh/id_dsa`
- If one of these files exists and matches the public key on the server, SSH will use it automatically to attempt the connection.

### 3. **SSH Configuration File (`~/.ssh/config`):**

- You can create an SSH configuration file that tells SSH which private key to use for specific servers or patterns of servers.

  _Example_ `~/.ssh/config`

  ```txt
  Host my-ec2
      HostName ec2-198-51-100-1.compute-1.amazonaws.com
      User ec2-user
      IdentityFile ~/.ssh/my-private-key.pem
  ```

- This configuration allows you to connect by simply typing `ssh my-ec2`, and SSH will automatically use the private key specified in `IdentityFile`.

## What Happens When You SSH into an AWS EC2 Instance

### **With `-i` Option:**

- If you use the `-i` option, SSH will use the specified private key:

```bash
ssh -i /path/to/your/private-key.pem ec2-user@your-ec2-instance-public-dns
```

### **Without `-i` Option:**

- If you donâ€™t specify a private key with the `-i` option, SSH will look for a default private key in `~/.ssh/`. If one exists and matches the public key stored on the EC2 instance, the connection will proceed.

## Summary

- **You don't initialize SSH with your private key manually each time**; instead, SSH uses the private key based on the command you give or the default files in `~/.ssh`.
- **If you use the `-i` option**, you specify which private key to use.
- **If you don't specify a key**, SSH tries to find one in the default `~/.ssh` directory.

This automatic process allows for secure and streamlined connections using SSH keys.
