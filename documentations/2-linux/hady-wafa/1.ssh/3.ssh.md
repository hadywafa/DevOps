# SSH Notes

## Connecting to Azure DevOps Repository with SSH

When you connect to an Azure DevOps repository using SSH, the process involves several steps to ensure secure authentication and data transfer. Hereâ€™s an in-depth look at the process, including key exchange, authentication, session establishment, and handling session timeouts.

### 1. Public Key Storage

When you add your public key to Azure DevOps, it is stored in your user profile. Azure DevOps associates this public key with your specific user account, allowing it to recognize and authenticate you.

### 2. Establishing the SSH Connection

#### Key Exchange

1. **Initiate Connection**: Your SSH client initiates a connection to the Azure DevOps server.
2. **Key Exchange Algorithm**: A key exchange algorithm (such as Diffie-Hellman) is used to securely establish a shared session key between your client and the server. This process involves:
   - **Generating Key Pairs**: Both your client and the server generate key pairs.
   - **Exchanging Information**: Necessary information is exchanged to derive the same session key on both ends without transmitting the actual key.

#### Authentication

1. **Server Challenge**: The server sends a challenge (a random number) to your client.
2. **Client Response**: Your client uses your private key to encrypt the challenge and sends it back to the server.
3. **Verification**: The server uses your public key to decrypt the response. If the decrypted response matches the original challenge, it proves your identity because only the corresponding private key could correctly encrypt the challenge.

### 3. Secure Session

#### Symmetric Encryption

After successful authentication, a secure session is established using symmetric encryption:

1. **Session Key**: The shared session key, derived during the key exchange, is used for symmetric encryption.
2. **Encrypted Communication**: All data transmitted during the session is encrypted using this session key, ensuring security and efficiency.

#### Data Integrity

1. **Message Authentication Codes (MACs)**: SSH uses MACs to ensure the integrity of the transmitted data, verifying that it has not been altered during transmission.

### 4. Pull Operation

A pull operation involves fetching changes from the remote repository to your local repository:

1. **Fetch Request**: Your Git client sends an encrypted fetch request to the server.
2. **Server Response**: The server processes the request and sends the changes back, encrypted with the session key.
3. **Local Update**: Your client decrypts the data and updates your local repository.

### 5. Push Operation

A push operation involves sending your local changes to the remote repository:

1. **Push Request**: Your Git client sends the local changes to the server, encrypted with the session key.
2. **Server Update**: The server decrypts the data, updates the remote repository, and sends an encrypted confirmation back.
3. **Local Confirmation**: Your client decrypts the confirmation and updates your local records.

### 6. SSH Session Timeout

SSH sessions can have a timeout configuration to automatically close idle sessions after a specified period:

#### Configuring SSH Timeouts

1. **Client-Side Configuration**: Set in your SSH configuration file (usually `~/.ssh/config`):

   - `ServerAliveInterval`: Specifies the interval (in seconds) that the client will wait before sending a null packet to keep the connection alive.
   - `ServerAliveCountMax`: Specifies the number of such packets sent without a response before disconnecting.

   ```plaintext
   Host *
       ServerAliveInterval 60
       ServerAliveCountMax 3
   ```

2. **Server-Side Configuration**: Set in the SSH daemon configuration file (usually `/etc/ssh/sshd_config`):

   - `ClientAliveInterval`: Specifies the interval (in seconds) that the server will wait before sending a null packet to keep the connection alive.
   - `ClientAliveCountMax`: Specifies the number of such packets sent without a response before disconnecting.

   ```plaintext
   ClientAliveInterval 60
   ClientAliveCountMax 3
   ```

#### Handling Session Timeout

1. **Reconnecting**: If your session times out, you need to reconnect by running your SSH command again. Your SSH client will handle authentication automatically if set up properly.
2. **Data Integrity**: Git operations are resilient. If a session ends in the middle of an operation, you can usually rerun the command after reconnecting, and Git will handle resuming or restarting the operation.

### Summary

- **Public Key Storage**: Azure DevOps stores your public key in your user profile.
- **SSH Connection Establishment**: Uses key exchange to establish a session key and authenticate with your private key.
- **Secure Session**: All data is encrypted with a session key, ensuring secure and efficient communication.
- **Pull and Push Operations**: Securely fetch or send data to the remote repository using the established session.
- **Session Timeout**: Configurable timeouts to maintain security, requiring reauthentication after a period of inactivity or a maximum session lifetime.

By understanding these processes, you can effectively manage secure connections and data transfers between your local environment and Azure DevOps repositories using SSH.
