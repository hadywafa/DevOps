## How to connect to your AWS EC2 instance again using an SSH alias

### 1. Create an SSH Alias

- Open your terminal or command prompt.

- Edit your SSH configuration file (usually located at`~/.ssh/config`).

- Add an alias for your EC2 instance:

```text
Host <aws-alias-server>
    HostName <your-instance-public-dns>
    User <server-user-name> # Use 'ubuntu' if you're using an Ubuntu instance.  
    IdentityFile </path/to/your-key.pem>
```

```text
Host aws-first-server
    HostName 198.02.4.6
    User ubuntu  
    IdentityFile ~/ssh/aws/my-first-web-server-ssh-key.pem
```

### 2. Connect Using the Alias

```text
ssh aws-my-first-server
```

## change the shell prompt (PS1) when connected to your EC2 instance

1. Open the shell configuration file (usually `.bashrc` or `.bash_profile`):
1. Look for a line that sets the `PS1` variable. It might look like this:  
    > PS1="\u@\h:\w$ "
1. Customize it to your desired prompt. For example:
    > PS1="aws-my-first-server:\w$ "
1. Source the modified configuration file to apply the changes immediately:
    > source ~/.bashrc
