```yaml
apiVersion: batch/v1
kind: Job
metadata:
  name: load-test
spec:
  template:
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: curl
          image: curlimages/curl:7.85.0
          command: ["/bin/sh", "-c"]
          args:
            - |
              echo "Starting load test..."
              URL="http://localhost"
              CONCURRENT_REQUESTS=5000
              DURATION=60

              echo "Starting load test for $URL with $CONCURRENT_REQUESTS concurrent requests for $DURATION seconds."

              for i in $(seq 1 $CONCURRENT_REQUESTS); do
                (while true; do curl -s -o /dev/null $URL; done) &
              done

              sleep $DURATION

              echo "Load test completed. Stopping all requests."
              pkill -f curl
      restartPolicy: Never
  backoffLimit: 0
```

1. **Apply the Kubernetes job**:

   ```bash
   kubectl apply -f load-test-job.yaml
   ```

2. **Monitor the job**:
   You can check the logs of the job to monitor the progress of your load test:

   ```bash
   kubectl logs -f job/load-test
   ```

3. **Cleanup**:
   Once the job is completed, you can delete it:

   ```bash
   kubectl delete job load-test
   ```

This corrected YAML file ensures that the `restartPolicy` is correctly set at the `spec.template.spec` level, allowing the job to run without errors.
