# Notes

- terminal syntax is case-sensitive
- Directory path has `/` at its end
- any command is just app or script than i call when run it using its full path or sugar syntax
  - `/usr/bin/pwd` == `pwd`
- profile path :
  - `default:[user-name]@[machine-name]:~$` : `hady@devops-vm:~$`
- shell vs terminal
- don't forgot last `/` in `cp` command because it will rename the dir of you forgot that.
- `echo $?` : used to know the output status
- `echo $0` : To Know current shell type, if shell name has `-`before it then it is login sell else it non-login shell.
