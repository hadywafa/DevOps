# Network Namespaces and Virtual Ethernet Interface (veth)

Network namespaces are a feature of the Linux kernel that allows for the creation of multiple isolated network stacks. Each network namespace can have its own network devices, IP addresses, routing tables, and firewall rules. This allows for the creation of isolated network environments within a single host.

Virtual Ethernet interfaces (veth) are a pair of virtual network interfaces that are used to connect two network namespaces. One end of the veth pair is placed in one network namespace, while the other end is placed in another network namespace. This allows for communication between processes running in different network namespaces.

When a container is created, a new network namespace is created for the container. A veth pair is then created, with one end placed in the container's network namespace and the other end placed in the host's network namespace. This allows the container to communicate with the host and other containers on the same host.

By using network namespaces and veth pairs, containers can be isolated from each other and from the host system, while still being able to communicate with each other and the outside world.

## Key Points

- Network namespaces allow for the creation of isolated network environments within a single host.
- Virtual Ethernet interfaces (veth) are used to connect network namespaces.
- Containers use network namespaces and veth pairs to communicate with each other and the host system.

- Network namespaces and veth pairs are implemented in the Linux kernel. Tools like `ip netns` and `ip link` can be used to create and manage network namespaces and veth pairs.

## Notes

- Network namespaces and veth pairs are used to create isolated network environments within a single host.
- Containers use network namespaces and veth pairs to communicate with each other and the host system.
- Tools like `ip netns` and `ip link` can be used to create and manage network namespaces and veth pairs.
