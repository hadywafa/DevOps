# Containers Components

## OCI (Open Container Initiative)

OCI is a set of rules that tell you how to build and run containers. If you follow these rules, your container will work on any system that supports OCI.

### How Does OCI Work?

1. **Image Spec**: This tells you how to build a container image. It defines things like how to create layers, how to add metadata, and how to create a manifest file.

2. **Runtime Spec**: This tells you how to run a container image. It defines things like how to create a container, how to start a container, and how to stop a container.

If you follow these rules, your container will work on any system that supports OCI. This makes it easier to move containers between different systems, and to use different tools to build and run containers.

### Why is OCI Important?

- Before OCI, there were lots of different ways to build and run containers. This made it hard to move containers between different systems, and to use different tools to work with containers.

- OCI helps solve this problem by providing a set of standards that everyone can follow. This makes it easier to build and run containers, and to move them between different systems.

## runc

- `runc` is the component that interacts directly with the Linux kernel to create the container. It sets up the necessary namespaces, cgroups, and other low-level isolation mechanisms, and then starts the containerized process.

- `runc` is built on top of the OCI runtime spec, so it can run any container that follows the OCI image spec.

- `runc` is used by many container runtimes, including Docker, containerd, and CRI-O. It is a key part of the OCI ecosystem, and is widely used in the container community.

## Containers Components by Categories

### 1. **Container Engines**

These are the high-level systems that manage everything about containers—from creating them to running and stopping them. They handle things like downloading container images, setting up networks, and managing storage.

- **Docker Engine**:

  - The most popular container engine that does everything from managing containers to running them.

- **Podman**:

  - Similar to Docker but doesn’t need a central service (daemon) to run containers. It’s often used as a drop-in replacement for Docker.

- **CRI-O**:

  - Designed specifically for Kubernetes, it integrates directly with Kubernetes to manage containers without needing Docker.

- **LXD**:

  - Focuses on system containers, which are like running full Linux systems in a container. It’s great for lightweight virtual machines.

- **containerd (Standalone)**:
  - Usually works under Docker, but can also be used by itself to manage containers directly.

### 2. **Container Runtimes**

These are the systems that handle the nitty-gritty details of running containers. They manage the container’s lifecycle—like starting, stopping, and deleting containers—and handle resources like storage and networking.

- **containerd**:

  - The default runtime used by Docker. It manages all the container operations and works with lower-level tools to actually run the containers.

- **CRI-O**:

  - Works directly with Kubernetes to manage containers. It’s designed to be lightweight and efficient, specifically for Kubernetes environments.

- **LXC**:

  - Often used for system containers, LXC provides more control over the container environment. It can act as both a runtime and a low-level tool for managing containers.

- **K3s Containerd**:
  - A streamlined version of containerd that’s bundled with K3s, a lightweight Kubernetes distribution. It’s optimized for small environments like edge computing.

### 3. **Low-Level Tools (OCI Runtimes)**

These are the tools that directly interact with the operating system to create and run containers. They handle things like setting up the container’s isolation (using cgroups and namespaces) and running the containerized process.

- **runc**:

  - The default tool used by Docker and containerd to actually run containers. It handles the low-level details of starting and managing container processes.

- **crun**:

  - A faster and lighter alternative to runc, written in C. It’s designed to be more efficient, especially in resource-constrained environments.

- **Kata Containers**:

  - Runs containers inside lightweight virtual machines, providing extra security by adding a layer of isolation. It’s great for environments where security is a top concern.

- **gVisor (runsc)**:

  - A sandboxed container runtime that provides a secure environment by running containers in a user-space kernel. It adds an extra layer of protection for containerized applications.

- **LXC**:
  - Also a low-level tool when used to manage container resources like namespaces and cgroups. It provides detailed control over how containers interact with the system.

### Summary

- **Container Engines**: Manage the overall lifecycle of containers (e.g., Docker Engine, Podman).
- **Container Runtimes**: Handle the creation, management, and deletion of containers (e.g., containerd, CRI-O).
- **Low-Level Tools**: Directly run containers and manage system resources (e.g., runc, crun, Kata Containers).
