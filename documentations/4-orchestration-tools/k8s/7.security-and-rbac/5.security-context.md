# Security Context in Kubernetes

Security is a paramount concern when deploying applications in Kubernetes (K8s). One of the fundamental mechanisms Kubernetes provides to enhance security is the **Security Context**. The `securityContext` field in Kubernetes allows you to define privilege and access control settings for Pods and Containers, ensuring that applications run with the least privileges necessary. This reduces the attack surface and helps in adhering to the principle of least privilege.

## 1. Understanding Security Context in Kubernetes

A **Security Context** defines privilege and access control settings for a Pod or Container. It encompasses various security-related configurations such as user IDs, group IDs, filesystem permissions, capabilities, and more. By specifying a security context, you can control how processes run within containers, ensuring they operate within defined security boundaries.

### Why Use Security Context?

- **Least Privilege:** Ensures containers run with only the permissions they need.
- **Isolation:** Enhances process isolation, preventing unauthorized access.
- **Compliance:** Helps meet security compliance standards by enforcing policies.
- **Defense in Depth:** Adds an additional layer of security to protect against vulnerabilities.

## 2. Key Components of Security Context

Security Context encompasses various settings that control the security aspects of Pods and Containers. Below are the primary fields you can configure:

### 2.1. `runAsUser`

- **Description:** Specifies the user ID (UID) the container's processes will run as.
- **Purpose:** Prevents containers from running as the root user, reducing the risk of privilege escalation.

- `runAsUser: 1` mean root user.

### 2.2. `runAsGroup`

- **Description:** Specifies the primary group ID (GID) for the container's processes.
- **Purpose:** Defines group permissions for processes, enabling more granular access control.

### 2.3. `fsGroup`

- **Description:** Defines a supplemental group ID for all processes in the container.
- **Purpose:** Sets group ownership for volumes mounted by the Pod, facilitating shared access.

### 2.4. `privileged`

- **Description:** Boolean flag indicating whether the container runs in privileged mode.
- **Purpose:** Grants elevated permissions, similar to root access on the host. **Use with caution**.

### 2.5. `allowPrivilegeEscalation`

- **Description:** Determines if a process can gain more privileges than its parent process.
- **Purpose:** Prevents containers from escalating their privileges, enhancing security.

### 2.6. `capabilities`

- **Description:** Adds or drops Linux capabilities for containers.
- **Purpose:** Grants only necessary capabilities to containers, minimizing potential misuse.

### 2.7. `readOnlyRootFilesystem`

- **Description:** Ensures the container's root filesystem is mounted as read-only.
- **Purpose:** Prevents unauthorized modifications to the filesystem, mitigating certain attack vectors.

### 2.8. `seccompProfile`

- **Description:** Specifies the seccomp profile to apply to the container.
- **Purpose:** Limits system calls available to containers, reducing the kernel's attack surface.

### 2.9. `SELinuxOptions` and `AppArmor`

- **Description:** Configures SELinux or AppArmor profiles for the container.
- **Purpose:** Enforces mandatory access control policies, providing robust security boundaries.

## 3. Configuring Security Context at Pod and Container Levels

Kubernetes allows you to set security contexts at both the **Pod** and **Container** levels. Settings defined at the Pod level apply to all containers within the Pod, while settings at the Container level override or extend Pod-level settings.

### 3.1. Pod-Level Security Context

Defines default security settings for all containers in the Pod.

**Example:**

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: pod-security-context
spec:
  securityContext:
    runAsUser: 1000
    runAsGroup: 3000
    fsGroup: 2000
    allowPrivilegeEscalation: false
    readOnlyRootFilesystem: true
  containers:
    - name: app-container
      image: your-application-image
      ports:
        - containerPort: 80
```

### 3.2. Container-Level Security Context

Overrides or supplements Pod-level settings for individual containers.

**Example:**

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: container-security-context
spec:
  securityContext:
    runAsUser: 1000
    fsGroup: 2000
  containers:
    - name: app-container
      image: your-application-image
      securityContext:
        runAsGroup: 3000
        allowPrivilegeEscalation: false
        capabilities:
          add:
            - NET_BIND_SERVICE
          drop:
            - ALL
      ports:
        - containerPort: 80
```

In this example:

- **Pod-Level:**

  - `runAsUser`: 1000
  - `fsGroup`: 2000

- **Container-Level:**
  - `runAsGroup`: 3000 (overrides Pod-level `runAsGroup` if set)
  - `allowPrivilegeEscalation`: false
  - **Capabilities:**
    - Adds `NET_BIND_SERVICE` to allow binding to ports below 1024.
    - Drops all other capabilities.

## 4. Best Practices for Using Security Context

Implementing security contexts effectively requires adherence to best practices to maximize security benefits.

### 4.1. Run as Non-Root User

Always run containers with a non-root user to minimize the impact of potential security breaches.

**Example:**

```yaml
securityContext:
  runAsUser: 1000
```

### 4.2. Define `runAsGroup` and `fsGroup`

Specify group IDs to control group-level permissions and access to shared volumes.

**Example:**

```yaml
securityContext:
  runAsGroup: 3000
  fsGroup: 2000
```

### 4.3. Restrict Privilege Escalation

Prevent containers from gaining additional privileges at runtime.

**Example:**

```yaml
securityContext:
  allowPrivilegeEscalation: false
```

### 4.4. Limit Linux Capabilities

Grant only the necessary Linux capabilities required by your application and drop all others.

**Example:**

```yaml
securityContext:
  capabilities:
    add:
      - NET_BIND_SERVICE
    drop:
      - ALL
```

### 4.5. Enforce Read-Only Filesystem

Mount the container's root filesystem as read-only to prevent unauthorized modifications.

**Example:**

```yaml
securityContext:
  readOnlyRootFilesystem: true
```

### 4.6. Use Seccomp and AppArmor Profiles

Apply seccomp and AppArmor profiles to restrict system calls and enforce mandatory access controls.

**Example with Seccomp:**

```yaml
securityContext:
  seccompProfile:
    type: RuntimeDefault
```

**Example with AppArmor:**

```yaml
metadata:
  annotations:
    container.apparmor.security.beta.kubernetes.io/app-container: localhost/my-profile
```

### 4.7. Regularly Review and Update Security Settings

Continuously assess and update security contexts to align with evolving security standards and application requirements.

## 5. Practical Examples

Let’s explore some practical examples demonstrating how to apply security contexts in different scenarios.

### 5.1. Basic Security Context

A simple Pod running as a non-root user with a read-only filesystem.

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: basic-security-context
spec:
  securityContext:
    runAsUser: 1000
    readOnlyRootFilesystem: true
  containers:
    - name: app-container
      image: your-application-image
      ports:
        - containerPort: 80
```

### 5.2. Enhanced Security Context with Capabilities and Seccomp

A Pod that requires specific capabilities and applies a seccomp profile.

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: enhanced-security-context
spec:
  securityContext:
    runAsUser: 1000
    runAsGroup: 3000
    fsGroup: 2000
    allowPrivilegeEscalation: false
  containers:
    - name: app-container
      image: your-application-image
      securityContext:
        capabilities:
          add:
            - NET_BIND_SERVICE
          drop:
            - ALL
        readOnlyRootFilesystem: true
        seccompProfile:
          type: RuntimeDefault
      ports:
        - containerPort: 80
```

### 5.3. Using Security Context with Service Accounts and RBAC

Integrating security contexts with Kubernetes Service Accounts and Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) to enforce fine-grained permissions.

**Service Account with Limited Permissions:**

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ServiceAccount
metadata:
  name: limited-serviceaccount
  namespace: your-namespace
```

**Deployment Referencing the Service Account:**

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: secure-deployment
  namespace: your-namespace
spec:
  replicas: 2
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: secure-app
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: secure-app
    spec:
      serviceAccountName: limited-serviceaccount
      securityContext:
        runAsUser: 1000
        runAsGroup: 3000
        fsGroup: 2000
        allowPrivilegeEscalation: false
      containers:
        - name: app-container
          image: your-application-image
          securityContext:
            capabilities:
              drop:
                - ALL
            readOnlyRootFilesystem: true
          ports:
            - containerPort: 80
```

**RBAC Role Limiting Access:**

```yaml
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: Role
metadata:
  namespace: your-namespace
  name: limited-role
rules:
  - apiGroups: [""]
    resources: ["pods"]
    verbs: ["get", "watch", "list"]
```

**Role Binding:**

```yaml
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: RoleBinding
metadata:
  name: bind-limited-role
  namespace: your-namespace
subjects:
  - kind: ServiceAccount
    name: limited-serviceaccount
    namespace: your-namespace
roleRef:
  kind: Role
  name: limited-role
  apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
```

## 6. Advanced Security Context Features

Beyond the basic configurations, Kubernetes offers advanced features to enhance security further.

### 6.1. Seccomp Profiles

Seccomp (Secure Computing Mode) restricts the system calls a container can make, reducing the risk of kernel exploits.

**Types of Seccomp Profiles:**

- **RuntimeDefault:** Uses the default profile provided by the container runtime.
- **Localhost:** Specifies a custom profile stored on the node.
- **Unconfined:** No seccomp restrictions (not recommended).

**Example: Applying RuntimeDefault Seccomp Profile**

```yaml
securityContext:
  seccompProfile:
    type: RuntimeDefault
```

### 6.2. AppArmor Profiles

AppArmor provides mandatory access control (MAC) for Linux applications, enforcing restrictions on programs.

**Example: Applying a Local AppArmor Profile**

```yaml
metadata:
  annotations:
    container.apparmor.security.beta.kubernetes.io/app-container: localhost/my-apparmor-profile
```

### 6.3. SELinux Options

SELinux (Security-Enhanced Linux) adds another layer of security by defining access policies.

**Example: Setting SELinux Context**

```yaml
securityContext:
  seLinuxOptions:
    level: "s0:c123,c456"
```
