## **Prerequisites**

Before proceeding, ensure the following:

- **Domain Configuration:**

  - Your domain `hadywafa.com` and all desired subdomains (`*.hadywafa.com`) are correctly pointed to the public IP `81.10.0.7` via **Namecheap**.
  - Example DNS Records in Namecheap:
    - `A` record for `hadywafa.com` → `81.10.0.7`
    - `A` record for `*.hadywafa.com` → `81.10.0.7`

- **Access Rights:**

  - Administrative (`sudo`) access to the Ubuntu VM, Docker host, and Kubernetes cluster.

- **Firewall Rules:**

  - Ports `80` (HTTP) and `443` (HTTPS) are open and accessible.

- **Software Requirements:**

  - **For VM and Docker:** Nginx installed on Ubuntu.
  - **For Kubernetes:** A functional Kubernetes cluster with an Ingress controller (e.g., Nginx Ingress) deployed.

- **DNS Access:**
  - Access to your Namecheap account to add and manage DNS records for manual DNS challenges.

> **Note:** Since **Namecheap** does not provide an official Certbot DNS plugin for automated DNS-01 challenges, this guide will utilize **manual DNS challenges** to obtain wildcard SSL certificates.

---

## **1. SSL for Host Application in a Virtual Machine (VM) on Ubuntu**

This section guides you through setting up SSL for a web application running directly on an Ubuntu VM using Nginx as the web server and Certbot for obtaining and managing SSL certificates.

### **1.1 Install Nginx**

If Nginx isn't installed on your Ubuntu VM, install it using `apt`.

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install nginx -y
```

### **1.2 Install Certbot**

Certbot automates the process of obtaining and renewing SSL certificates.

```bash
sudo apt install certbot -y
```

### **1.3 Obtain Wildcard SSL Certificates with Certbot (Manual DNS Challenge)**

Since Namecheap doesn't have an official Certbot DNS plugin, you'll need to perform a **manual DNS challenge** to obtain wildcard certificates.

1. **Run Certbot for Manual DNS Challenge:**

   ```bash
   sudo certbot certonly \
     --manual \
     --manual-public-ip-logging-ok \
     --preferred-challenges dns-01 \
     -d hadywafa.com -d *.hadywafa.com \
     --agree-tos \
     --email your-email@example.com \
     --no-eff-email
   ```

   - **Parameters Explained:**
     - `certonly`: Obtain the certificate without installing it.
     - `--manual`: Perform manual verification.
     - `--preferred-challenges dns-01`: Use DNS challenge for verification.
     - `-d`: Domains to include in the certificate (both root and wildcard).
     - `--agree-tos`: Agree to Let's Encrypt terms of service.
     - `--email`: Your email for urgent renewal and security notices.
     - `--no-eff-email`: Opt-out of EFF email subscriptions.

2. **Follow Certbot Prompts:**

   Certbot will prompt you to create TXT records in your DNS for each domain.

   - **Example Prompt:**

     ```
     Please deploy a DNS TXT record under the name
     _acme-challenge.hadywafa.com with the following value:

     abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz1234567890

     Before continuing, verify the record is deployed.
     ```

3. **Add TXT Records in Namecheap:**

   - **Log in to Your Namecheap Account.**
   - **Navigate to "Domain List" and Click "Manage" Next to `hadywafa.com`.**
   - **Go to the "Advanced DNS" Tab.**
   - **Add New TXT Records:**
     - **Host:** `_acme-challenge.hadywafa.com`
     - **Value:** The value provided by Certbot (e.g., `abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz1234567890`)
     - **TTL:** Automatic or 30 minutes
   - **Repeat for Each Prompt Provided by Certbot.**

4. **Complete Certbot Verification:**

   After adding the TXT records, return to the Certbot terminal and press **Enter** to continue. Certbot will verify the DNS records and issue the certificates if successful.

### **1.4 Configure Nginx for SSL**

After obtaining the certificates, configure Nginx to use them.

1. **Create Nginx Server Block for `hadywafa.com`:**

   ```bash
   sudo nano /etc/nginx/sites-available/hadywafa.com.conf
   ```

2. **Add the Following Configuration:**

   ```nginx
   server {
       listen 80;
       server_name hadywafa.com *.hadywafa.com;

       # Redirect all HTTP requests to HTTPS
       location / {
           return 301 https://$host$request_uri;
       }
   }

   server {
       listen 443 ssl;
       server_name hadywafa.com *.hadywafa.com;

       ssl_certificate /etc/letsencrypt/live/hadywafa.com/fullchain.pem;
       ssl_certificate_key /etc/letsencrypt/live/hadywafa.com/privkey.pem;

       # SSL settings
       ssl_protocols TLSv1.2 TLSv1.3;
       ssl_prefer_server_ciphers on;
       ssl_ciphers HIGH:!aNULL:!MD5;

       # Optional: Enable HSTS
       add_header Strict-Transport-Security "max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains" always;

       root /var/www/hadywafa.com/html;
       index index.html index.htm;

       location / {
           try_files $uri $uri/ =404;
       }
   }
   ```

   > **Note:** Ensure that the paths to the SSL certificates match where Certbot stored them.

3. **Enable the Server Block:**

   ```bash
   sudo ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/hadywafa.com.conf /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/
   ```

4. **Test Nginx Configuration and Reload:**

   ```bash
   sudo nginx -t
   sudo systemctl reload nginx
   ```

### **1.5 Verify SSL Installation**

Visit `https://hadywafa.com` and any subdomain (e.g., `https://sub.hadywafa.com`) in your browser to verify that the SSL certificate is correctly installed. You should see a secure padlock icon indicating a secure connection.

### **1.6 Automate Certificate Renewal**

Let's Encrypt certificates are valid for 90 days. Automate the renewal process using a cron job.

1. **Create a Renewal Script:**

   ```bash
   sudo nano /usr/local/bin/renew_cert.sh
   ```

   **Add the Following Content:**

   ```bash
   #!/bin/bash

   certbot renew --manual --preferred-challenges dns-01 --deploy-hook "systemctl reload nginx"
   ```

   > **Note:** Since this is a manual DNS challenge, automation is limited. The script will attempt renewal, but you'll need to manually add TXT records when prompted.

2. **Make the Script Executable:**

   ```bash
   sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/renew_cert.sh
   ```

3. **Set Up a Cron Job:**

   Open the root crontab:

   ```bash
   sudo crontab -e
   ```

   **Add the Following Line to Run Renewal Twice Daily:**

   ```cron
   0 0,12 * * * /usr/local/bin/renew_cert.sh >> /var/log/certbot-renew.log 2>&1
   ```

   > **Note:** For manual DNS challenges, you will need to handle DNS record updates during renewal. Alternatively, consider using a DNS provider with API support for automation.

4. **Verify Renewal Process:**

   Perform a dry run to ensure renewal works as expected.

   ```bash
   sudo certbot renew --dry-run
   ```

   > **Note:** With manual DNS challenges, the dry run may prompt for DNS updates. Ensure you have access to Namecheap's DNS management to add necessary TXT records when required.

## **2. SSL for Applications Hosted in Docker Containers on Ubuntu**

Securing applications running inside Docker containers involves managing SSL certificates either on the host or within the containers. This section demonstrates setting up SSL using a reverse proxy (Nginx) on the Docker host to handle SSL termination with Let's Encrypt certificates via manual DNS challenges.

### **2.1 Install Docker and Docker Compose**

If Docker and Docker Compose aren't installed on your Ubuntu host, install them.

1. **Install Docker:**

   ```bash
   sudo apt update
   sudo apt install apt-transport-https ca-certificates curl software-properties-common -y
   curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg | sudo apt-key add -
   sudo add-apt-repository "deb [arch=amd64] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu $(lsb_release -cs) stable"
   sudo apt update
   sudo apt install docker-ce -y
   sudo systemctl enable --now docker
   ```

2. **Install Docker Compose:**

   ```bash
   sudo curl -L "https://github.com/docker/compose/releases/download/v2.20.0/docker-compose-$(uname -s)-$(uname -m)" -o /usr/local/bin/docker-compose
   sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/docker-compose
   ```

   > **Note:** Replace `v2.20.0` with the latest stable version if necessary.

### **2.2 Set Up a Reverse Proxy with Nginx and Let's Encrypt**

Using Docker Compose, set up Nginx as a reverse proxy that handles SSL termination and forwards requests to your application containers.

1. **Create Project Directory:**

   ```bash
   mkdir -p ~/docker/nginx-proxy
   cd ~/docker/nginx-proxy
   ```

2. **Create Docker Network:**

   Create a dedicated Docker network for communication between containers.

   ```bash
   docker network create webnet
   ```

3. **Create `docker-compose.yml`:**

   ```yaml
   version: "3"

   services:
     nginx:
       image: nginx:latest
       container_name: nginx-proxy
       ports:
         - "80:80"
         - "443:443"
       volumes:
         - ./data/certbot/conf:/etc/letsencrypt
         - ./data/certbot/www:/var/www/certbot
         - ./nginx/conf.d:/etc/nginx/conf.d
         - ./nginx/html:/usr/share/nginx/html
       networks:
         - webnet

     certbot:
       image: certbot/certbot
       container_name: certbot
       volumes:
         - ./data/certbot/conf:/etc/letsencrypt
         - ./data/certbot/www:/var/www/certbot
       entrypoint: '/bin/sh -c ''trap exit TERM; while :; do sleep 12h & wait $${!}; certbot renew --manual --preferred-challenges dns-01 --deploy-hook "nginx -s reload"; done;'''
       networks:
         - webnet

   networks:
     webnet:
       driver: bridge
   ```

   > **Note:** The `certbot` service is configured to attempt renewal every 12 hours. Since we're using manual DNS challenges, renewals will require manual intervention.

4. **Configure Nginx for Let's Encrypt and Reverse Proxy:**

   Create the Nginx configuration files to handle SSL and proxying.

   ```bash
   mkdir -p nginx/conf.d
   nano nginx/conf.d/hadywafa.com.conf
   ```

   **Add the Following Configuration:**

   ```nginx
   server {
       listen 80;
       server_name hadywafa.com *.hadywafa.com;

       location /.well-known/acme-challenge/ {
           root /var/www/certbot;
       }

       location / {
           return 301 https://$host$request_uri;
       }
   }

   server {
       listen 443 ssl;
       server_name hadywafa.com *.hadywafa.com;

       ssl_certificate /etc/letsencrypt/live/hadywafa.com/fullchain.pem;
       ssl_certificate_key /etc/letsencrypt/live/hadywafa.com/privkey.pem;

       ssl_protocols TLSv1.2 TLSv1.3;
       ssl_prefer_server_ciphers on;
       ssl_ciphers HIGH:!aNULL:!MD5;

       add_header Strict-Transport-Security "max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains" always;

       location / {
           proxy_pass http://app:8080; # Replace with your application's internal address and port
           proxy_set_header Host $host;
           proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
           proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
           proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
       }
   }
   ```

   > **Note:** Replace `http://app:8080` with the actual internal address and port of your application container.

5. **Obtain Wildcard SSL Certificates with Certbot (Manual DNS Challenge):**

   Since Namecheap requires manual DNS challenges, perform the following steps:

   ```bash
   sudo certbot certonly \
     --manual \
     --preferred-challenges dns-01 \
     -d hadywafa.com -d *.hadywafa.com \
     --agree-tos \
     --email your-email@example.com \
     --no-eff-email \
     --manual-public-ip-logging-ok
   ```

6. **Follow Certbot Prompts:**

   Certbot will prompt you to create TXT records in your DNS for each domain.

   - **Example Prompt:**

     ```
     Please deploy a DNS TXT record under the name
     _acme-challenge.hadywafa.com with the following value:

     abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz1234567890

     Before continuing, verify the record is deployed.
     ```

7. **Add TXT Records in Namecheap:**

   - **Log in to Your Namecheap Account.**
   - **Navigate to "Domain List" and Click "Manage" Next to `hadywafa.com`.**
   - **Go to the "Advanced DNS" Tab.**
   - **Add New TXT Records:**
     - **Host:** `_acme-challenge.hadywafa.com`
     - **Value:** The value provided by Certbot (e.g., `abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz1234567890`)
     - **TTL:** Automatic or 30 minutes
   - **Repeat for Each Prompt Provided by Certbot.**

8. **Complete Certbot Verification:**

   After adding the TXT records, return to the Certbot terminal and press **Enter** to continue. Certbot will verify the DNS records and issue the certificates if successful.

### **2.4 Start Nginx and Certbot Services**

Start the services using Docker Compose.

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

### **2.5 Deploy Your Application Container**

Ensure your application is deployed on the same Docker network (`webnet`) and is accessible by Nginx.

1. **Create Application `docker-compose.yml`:**

   ```yaml
   version: "3"

   services:
     app:
       image: your-app-image:latest
       container_name: app
       expose:
         - "8080"
       networks:
         - webnet

   networks:
     webnet:
       external: true
   ```

   > **Note:** Replace `your-app-image:latest` with your actual application image.

2. **Deploy the Application:**

   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

### **2.6 Verify SSL Installation**

Visit `https://hadywafa.com` and any subdomain (e.g., `https://api.hadywafa.com`) to verify that the SSL certificate is correctly installed.

### **2.7 Automate Certificate Renewal**

Since we're using manual DNS challenges, automatic renewal isn't straightforward. However, you can set reminders to renew certificates before expiration.

1. **Create a Renewal Reminder Script:**

   ```bash
   sudo nano /usr/local/bin/renew_cert_docker.sh
   ```

   **Add the Following Content:**

   ```bash
   #!/bin/bash

   certbot renew --manual --preferred-challenges dns-01 --deploy-hook "docker exec nginx-proxy nginx -s reload"
   ```

2. **Make the Script Executable:**

   ```bash
   sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/renew_cert_docker.sh
   ```

3. **Set Up a Cron Job:**

   Open the root crontab:

   ```bash
   sudo crontab -e
   ```

   **Add the Following Line to Run Renewal Twice Daily:**

   ```cron
   0 0,12 * * * /usr/local/bin/renew_cert_docker.sh >> /var/log/certbot-renew-docker.log 2>&1
   ```

   > **Note:** Each renewal attempt will require manual DNS updates in Namecheap. Consider setting up notifications to remind you when renewal is needed.

4. **Verify Renewal Process:**

   Perform a dry run to ensure renewal works as expected.

   ```bash
   sudo certbot renew --dry-run
   ```

   > **Note:** With manual DNS challenges, the dry run may prompt for DNS updates. Ensure you have access to Namecheap's DNS management to add necessary TXT records when required.

## **3. SSL for Applications Hosted in Kubernetes Deployments with Ingress on Ubuntu**

Securing Kubernetes applications typically involves using an Ingress controller combined with a certificate management solution like Cert-Manager to automate SSL certificate provisioning from Let's Encrypt. Since Namecheap requires manual DNS challenges for wildcard certificates, we'll integrate manual steps into the Kubernetes setup.

### **3.1 Set Up a Kubernetes Cluster with Nginx Ingress Controller**

Assuming you have a Kubernetes cluster up and running on Ubuntu. If not, you can set up a cluster using tools like [kubeadm](https://kubernetes.io/docs/setup/production-environment/tools/kubeadm/create-cluster-kubeadm/) or use managed services like [MicroK8s](https://microk8s.io/) for local testing.

1. **Install Nginx Ingress Controller Using Helm:**

   **Add the Ingress-Nginx Helm Repository:**

   ```bash
   helm repo add ingress-nginx https://kubernetes.github.io/ingress-nginx
   helm repo update
   ```

   **Install the Ingress-Nginx Helm Chart:**

   ```bash
   helm install ingress-nginx ingress-nginx/ingress-nginx \
     --namespace ingress-nginx --create-namespace
   ```

2. **Verify Ingress Controller Installation:**

   ```bash
   kubectl get pods -n ingress-nginx
   ```

   You should see pods like `ingress-nginx-controller` running.

### **3.2 Install Cert-Manager**

Cert-Manager automates the management and issuance of TLS certificates.

1. **Add the Jetstack Helm Repository:**

   ```bash
   helm repo add jetstack https://charts.jetstack.io
   helm repo update
   ```

2. **Install CustomResourceDefinitions (CRDs):**

   ```bash
   kubectl apply --validate=false -f https://github.com/jetstack/cert-manager/releases/download/v1.11.1/cert-manager.crds.yaml
   ```

3. **Install Cert-Manager via Helm:**

   ```bash
   helm install cert-manager jetstack/cert-manager \
     --namespace cert-manager --create-namespace \
     --version v1.11.1
   ```

4. **Verify Cert-Manager Installation:**

   ```bash
   kubectl get pods -n cert-manager
   ```

   Pods like `cert-manager`, `cert-manager-cainjector`, and `cert-manager-webhook` should be running.

### **3.3 Configure Let's Encrypt ClusterIssuer for Wildcard Certificates (Manual DNS Challenge)**

Since Namecheap doesn't support automated DNS challenges via API, we'll use manual DNS challenges with Cert-Manager's `manual` solver.

1. **Create a Secret for Cert-Manager (Optional):**

   If you have any necessary credentials or configuration, create a Kubernetes secret. For manual DNS challenges, this might not be necessary.

2. **Create a ClusterIssuer YAML File:**

   ```bash
   nano cluster-issuer.yaml
   ```

3. **Add the Following Configuration Using the `manual` Solver:**

   ```yaml
   apiVersion: cert-manager.io/v1
   kind: ClusterIssuer
   metadata:
     name: letsencrypt-prod
   spec:
     acme:
       server: https://acme-v02.api.letsencrypt.org/directory
       email: your-email@example.com
       privateKeySecretRef:
         name: letsencrypt-prod
       solvers:
         - dns01:
             webhook:
               group: acme.cert-manager.io
               version: v1
               kind: ChallengeSolver
               name: manual-solver
               # Additional webhook configuration would go here if automating
               # Since we're using manual challenges, the webhook is not applicable
   ```

   > **Note:** Cert-Manager does not natively support manual DNS challenges out-of-the-box. To handle manual DNS challenges, you would need to use an external webhook or manually create `CertificateRequest` resources. For simplicity, we'll proceed with annotations and manual steps.

4. **Apply the ClusterIssuer:**

   ```bash
   kubectl apply -f cluster-issuer.yaml
   ```

5. **Verify ClusterIssuer Creation:**

   ```bash
   kubectl get clusterissuer
   ```

   You should see `letsencrypt-prod` listed with the status `Ready` or `False` pending DNS challenge completion.

> **Alternative Approach:** Given the complexity of integrating manual DNS challenges with Cert-Manager, consider using `cert-manager`'s manual DNS challenge documentation or explore community solutions that facilitate manual challenges.

### **3.4 Deploy Your Application with Ingress and TLS**

1. **Deploy Your Application:**

   Create a deployment and service for your application.

   **Example `app-deployment.yaml`:**

   ```yaml
   apiVersion: apps/v1
   kind: Deployment
   metadata:
     name: my-app
     labels:
       app: my-app
   spec:
     replicas: 2
     selector:
       matchLabels:
         app: my-app
     template:
       metadata:
         labels:
           app: my-app
       spec:
         containers:
           - name: my-app
             image: your-app-image:latest
             ports:
               - containerPort: 8080
   ```

   **Apply the Deployment:**

   ```bash
   kubectl apply -f app-deployment.yaml
   ```

2. **Expose the Deployment as a Service:**

   **Example `app-service.yaml`:**

   ```yaml
   apiVersion: v1
   kind: Service
   metadata:
     name: my-app-service
   spec:
     selector:
       app: my-app
     ports:
       - protocol: TCP
         port: 80
         targetPort: 8080
   ```

   **Apply the Service:**

   ```bash
   kubectl apply -f app-service.yaml
   ```

3. **Create an Ingress Resource with TLS:**

   **Example `app-ingress.yaml`:**

   ```yaml
   apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
   kind: Ingress
   metadata:
     name: my-app-ingress
     annotations:
       kubernetes.io/ingress.class: "nginx"
       cert-manager.io/cluster-issuer: "letsencrypt-prod"
       nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/force-ssl-redirect: "true"
   spec:
     tls:
       - hosts:
           - hadywafa.com
           - "*.hadywafa.com"
         secretName: hadywafa-com-tls
     rules:
       - host: hadywafa.com
         http:
           paths:
             - path: /
               pathType: Prefix
               backend:
                 service:
                   name: my-app-service
                   port:
                     number: 80
       - host: api.hadywafa.com
         http:
           paths:
             - path: /
               pathType: Prefix
               backend:
                 service:
                   name: my-app-service
                   port:
                     number: 80
   ```

   > **Note:** Replace `api.hadywafa.com` with your actual subdomains as needed.

   **Apply the Ingress:**

   ```bash
   kubectl apply -f app-ingress.yaml
   ```

4. **Create a Certificate Resource:**

   Since we're using manual DNS challenges, you'll need to create a `Certificate` resource that triggers Cert-Manager to request the certificate and then manually add the required DNS TXT records.

   **Example `certificate.yaml`:**

   ```yaml
   apiVersion: cert-manager.io/v1
   kind: Certificate
   metadata:
     name: hadywafa-com-tls
     namespace: default
   spec:
     secretName: hadywafa-com-tls
     issuerRef:
       name: letsencrypt-prod
       kind: ClusterIssuer
     commonName: hadywafa.com
     dnsNames:
       - hadywafa.com
       - "*.hadywafa.com"
   ```

   **Apply the Certificate:**

   ```bash
   kubectl apply -f certificate.yaml
   ```

5. **Add DNS TXT Records in Namecheap:**

   After applying the `Certificate` resource, Cert-Manager will create `CertificateRequest` resources and attempt to fulfill them by creating DNS TXT records. Since automation isn't possible with manual challenges, you'll need to:

   - **Check the CertificateRequest:**

     ```bash
     kubectl describe certificaterequest -A
     ```

     Look for the TXT record details provided by Cert-Manager.

   - **Add TXT Records in Namecheap:**

     - **Log in to Your Namecheap Account.**
     - **Navigate to "Domain List" and Click "Manage" Next to `hadywafa.com`.**
     - **Go to the "Advanced DNS" Tab.**
     - **Add New TXT Records as Provided by Cert-Manager:**
       - **Host:** `_acme-challenge.hadywafa.com`
       - **Value:** The value provided by Cert-Manager
       - **TTL:** Automatic or 30 minutes
     - **Repeat for Each TXT Record as Needed.**

6. **Complete Certificate Issuance:**

   After adding the TXT records, Cert-Manager should detect the verification and issue the certificate, storing it in the specified secret (`hadywafa-com-tls`).

### **3.5 Verify Certificate Issuance**

1. **Check Certificate Status:**

   ```bash
   kubectl get certificates
   ```

   You should see `hadywafa-com-tls` with a status indicating the certificate is ready.

2. **Check Secret:**

   ```bash
   kubectl get secret hadywafa-com-tls -o yaml
   ```

   Ensure that the `tls.crt` and `tls.key` fields are populated.

3. **Test Access:**

   Visit `https://hadywafa.com` and any subdomain (e.g., `https://api.hadywafa.com`) in your browser to verify that SSL is correctly configured and the connection is secure.

### **3.6 Automate Certificate Renewal**

Given the manual nature of DNS challenges with Namecheap, automation is limited. However, you can set reminders to renew certificates before expiration.

1. **Monitor Certificate Expiry:**

   ```bash
   kubectl describe certificate hadywafa-com-tls
   ```

   Look for the `Not After` field to see the certificate's expiration date.

2. **Renew Certificates Manually:**

   To renew, delete the existing certificate and recreate it, following the same manual DNS challenge steps.

   ```bash
   kubectl delete certificate hadywafa-com-tls
   kubectl apply -f certificate.yaml
   ```

3. **Consider External Automation (Advanced):**

   If you prefer automation, consider developing a custom script or webhook that interacts with Namecheap's DNS API to add TXT records. This requires programming knowledge and handling API credentials securely.

## **4. SSL for Kubernetes Using an SSL-Only Load Balancer**

In addition to using Ingress controllers for SSL termination, Kubernetes can utilize **SSL-only load balancers** that handle SSL termination externally. This approach can be beneficial in certain scenarios, such as when using managed load balancers or when centralized SSL management is desired.

### **4.1 Overview of SSL-Only Load Balancer Approach**

An **SSL-only load balancer** handles all SSL termination, managing SSL certificates and decrypting HTTPS traffic before forwarding it to the backend services (Kubernetes services). This approach centralizes SSL management, offloads SSL processing from application servers, and can enhance performance.

**Advantages:**

- Centralized SSL certificate management.
- Offloads SSL processing from backend services.
- Simplifies backend service configurations.
- Can integrate with existing infrastructure.

**Considerations:**

- Requires a separate load balancer setup.
- Potentially higher complexity depending on the environment.

### **4.2 Set Up an SSL-Only Load Balancer on Ubuntu**

For demonstration purposes, we'll set up an **Nginx-based SSL-only load balancer** on an Ubuntu server. In production, you might use a more robust solution or a managed service.

1. **Install Nginx:**

   ```bash
   sudo apt update
   sudo apt install nginx -y
   ```

2. **Install Certbot:**

   ```bash
   sudo apt install certbot -y
   ```

### **4.3 Configure Load Balancer to Handle SSL Termination**

1. **Obtain Wildcard SSL Certificates with Certbot (Manual DNS Challenge):**

   ```bash
   sudo certbot certonly \
     --manual \
     --preferred-challenges dns-01 \
     -d hadywafa.com -d *.hadywafa.com \
     --agree-tos \
     --email your-email@example.com \
     --no-eff-email \
     --manual-public-ip-logging-ok
   ```

2. **Follow Certbot Prompts to Add TXT Records in Namecheap:**

   As described in previous sections, add the required TXT records in Namecheap's DNS management interface.

3. **Configure Nginx as SSL-Only Load Balancer:**

   Edit Nginx configuration to handle SSL termination and proxy traffic to Kubernetes services.

   ```bash
   sudo nano /etc/nginx/sites-available/loadbalancer.conf
   ```

   **Add the Following Configuration:**

   ```nginx
   server {
       listen 443 ssl;
       server_name hadywafa.com *.hadywafa.com;

       ssl_certificate /etc/letsencrypt/live/hadywafa.com/fullchain.pem;
       ssl_certificate_key /etc/letsencrypt/live/hadywafa.com/privkey.pem;

       ssl_protocols TLSv1.2 TLSv1.3;
       ssl_prefer_server_ciphers on;
       ssl_ciphers HIGH:!aNULL:!MD5;

       add_header Strict-Transport-Security "max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains" always;

       # Example proxy to Kubernetes service using ClusterIP
       location / {
           proxy_pass http://<k8s-service-ip>:<port>;
           proxy_set_header Host $host;
           proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
           proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
           proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
       }
   }

   # Optionally redirect HTTP to HTTPS
   server {
       listen 80;
       server_name hadywafa.com *.hadywafa.com;

       location / {
           return 301 https://$host$request_uri;
       }
   }
   ```

   > **Note:** Replace `<k8s-service-ip>` and `<port>` with the actual **ClusterIP** and port of your Kubernetes service. Alternatively, if your Kubernetes services are exposed via **NodePort**, use the **Node IP** and **NodePort**.

4. **Enable the Nginx Configuration:**

   ```bash
   sudo ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/loadbalancer.conf /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/
   ```

5. **Test Nginx Configuration and Reload:**

   ```bash
   sudo nginx -t
   sudo systemctl reload nginx
   ```

### **4.4 Deploy Applications in Kubernetes to Use the Load Balancer**

In this setup, your Kubernetes services should be accessible by the load balancer. Here's how to configure them:

1. **Expose Kubernetes Services via NodePort:**

   **Example `app-service-nodeport.yaml`:**

   ```yaml
   apiVersion: v1
   kind: Service
   metadata:
     name: my-app-service
   spec:
     type: NodePort
     selector:
       app: my-app
     ports:
       - protocol: TCP
         port: 80
         targetPort: 8080
         nodePort: 30080
   ```

   **Apply the Service:**

   ```bash
   kubectl apply -f app-service-nodeport.yaml
   ```

2. **Update Nginx Load Balancer Configuration:**

   In `/etc/nginx/sites-available/loadbalancer.conf`, set `proxy_pass` to the Kubernetes Node IP and NodePort.

   **Example:**

   ```nginx
   location / {
       proxy_pass http://81.10.0.7:30080;
       proxy_set_header Host $host;
       proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
       proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
       proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
   }
   ```

3. **Restart Nginx to Apply Changes:**

   ```bash
   sudo systemctl reload nginx
   ```

### **4.5 Verify SSL Configuration**

1. **Test Access:**

   Visit `https://hadywafa.com` and any subdomain (e.g., `https://api.hadywafa.com`) to verify that SSL is correctly configured and the connection is secure.

2. **Check Certificate Details:**

   Ensure that the certificate covers both `hadywafa.com` and `*.hadywafa.com`.

### **4.6 Automate Certificate Renewal**

Given the manual nature of DNS challenges with Namecheap, automate as much as possible.

1. **Create a Renewal Reminder Script:**

   ```bash
   sudo nano /usr/local/bin/renew_cert_loadbalancer.sh
   ```

   **Add the Following Content:**

   ```bash
   #!/bin/bash

   certbot renew --manual --preferred-challenges dns-01 --deploy-hook "systemctl reload nginx"
   ```

2. **Make the Script Executable:**

   ```bash
   sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/renew_cert_loadbalancer.sh
   ```

3. **Set Up a Cron Job:**

   Open the root crontab:

   ```bash
   sudo crontab -e
   ```

   **Add the Following Line to Run Renewal Twice Daily:**

   ```cron
   0 0,12 * * * /usr/local/bin/renew_cert_loadbalancer.sh >> /var/log/certbot-renew-loadbalancer.log 2>&1
   ```

   > **Note:** Each renewal attempt will require manual DNS updates in Namecheap. Set reminders to handle renewals before certificate expiration.

4. **Verify Renewal Process:**

   Perform a dry run to ensure renewal works as expected.

   ```bash
   sudo certbot renew --dry-run
   ```

   > **Note:** With manual DNS challenges, the dry run may prompt for DNS updates. Ensure you have access to Namecheap's DNS management to add necessary TXT records when required.
