## 🔍 **Overview of Cluster Upgrades**

### **1. Purpose of Upgrading**

- **🔒 Improve Security:** Patch vulnerabilities and enhance security features.
- **⚡ Boost Performance:** Optimize cluster performance and resource management.
- **🛠️ Access New Features:** Utilize the latest Kubernetes features and enhancements.
- **🐛 Fix Bugs:** Resolve known issues to improve cluster stability.
- **🔄 Ensure Compatibility:** Maintain compatibility with other tools and dependencies.

### **2. Types of Upgrades**

- **Control Plane Upgrade:** Involves upgrading the Kubernetes master components, including the API server, scheduler, and controller manager.
- **Worker Node Upgrade:** Involves upgrading the nodes that run your application workloads.

## 🛠️ **Pre-Upgrade Preparation**

### 💾 **Backup Your Cluster**

#### **a. Backup `etcd`**

`etcd` is the primary data store for Kubernetes. Backing it up is crucial.

```bash
ETCDCTL_API=3 etcdctl snapshot save /path/to/backup.db \
  --endpoints=https://127.0.0.1:2379 \
  --cacert=/etc/kubernetes/pki/etcd/ca.crt \
  --cert=/etc/kubernetes/pki/etcd/server.crt \
  --key=/etc/kubernetes/pki/etcd/server.key
```

> **Note:** Adjust the paths if your `etcd` certificates are located elsewhere.

#### **b. Backup Kubernetes Configurations**

Backup manifests, Helm charts, and configurations.

```bash
kubectl get --all-namespaces -o yaml > all-cluster-resources.yaml
kubectl get configmaps --all-namespaces -o yaml > all-configmaps.yaml
kubectl get secrets --all-namespaces -o yaml > all-secrets.yaml
```

### 🔄 **Changing the Package Repository**

**Important:** Starting from September 13, 2023, the legacy package repositories (`apt.kubernetes.io` and `yum.kubernetes.io`) have been deprecated and frozen. It's essential to switch to the new community-owned package repositories (`pkgs.k8s.io`) to install Kubernetes versions released after this date.

#### **1. Enable the New Package Repository**

**For Debian/Ubuntu:**

```bash
# Create the directory for the Kubernetes apt keyring if it doesn't exist
sudo mkdir -p /etc/apt/keyrings

# Add the new Kubernetes GPG key
curl -fsSL https://pkgs.k8s.io/core:/stable:/v1.30/deb/Release.key | sudo gpg --dearmor -o /etc/apt/keyrings/kubernetes-apt-keyring.gpg

# Add the new Kubernetes repository
echo "deb [signed-by=/etc/apt/keyrings/kubernetes-apt-keyring.gpg] https://pkgs.k8s.io/core:/stable:/v1.30/deb/ /" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/kubernetes.list
```

> **📌 Note:** Replace `v1.30` in the URLs with the specific Kubernetes version you intend to upgrade to (e.g., `v1.31`).
>
> **📌 Reference:** [Changing the Kubernetes Package Repository](https://v1-29.docs.kubernetes.io/blog/2023/08/15/pkgs-k8s-io-introduction/)

#### **2. Update Package Lists**

```bash
sudo apt-get update
```

> **⚠️ Warning:** Ensure that the package manager recognizes the new repository before proceeding with the upgrade.

### 🔢 **Determine which version to upgrade**

```bash
# Find the latest 1.29 version in the list.
# It should look like 1.29.x-*, where x is the latest patch.
sudo apt update
sudo apt-cache madison kubeadm
```

## 🏗️ **Upgrade Control Plane (Master Nodes)**

**Note:** Always upgrade the control plane nodes one at a time to maintain cluster availability.

### 1. Drain the Node (if it not taints)

Prepare the master node for maintenance by draining it. This will safely evict all pods from the node and mark it as unschedulables

```bash
kubectl drain <node-name> --ignore-daemonsets --delete-emptydir-data
```

### 2. Upgrade `kubeadm`

Begin by upgrading `kubeadm` on the control plane node.

```bash
# Unhold kubeadm to allow version changes
sudo apt-mark unhold kubeadm

# Update package lists and install the desired kubeadm version
sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install -y kubeadm=1.30.0-00

# Hold kubeadm at the current version to prevent automatic upgrades
sudo apt-mark hold kubeadm
```

> **📌 Note:** Replace `1.30.0-00` with the specific version you intend to upgrade to (e.g., `1.30.5-00`).

### 3. Plan the Upgrade

Use `kubeadm` to check the available upgrade versions and review any potential issues.

```bash
kubeadm upgrade plan
```

> **📌 Reference:** [kubeadm upgrade plan](https://v1-29.docs.kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/administer-cluster/kubeadm/kubeadm-upgrade/)

### 4. Apply the Upgrade

Proceed to upgrade the Kubernetes control plane to the desired version.

```bash
# for first master node
sudo kubeadm upgrade apply v1.30.0

# for other master nodes
sudo kubeadm upgrade node
```

> **📌 Note:** Replace `v1.30.0` with your target Kubernetes version (e.g., `v1.30.5`).

### 5. Upgrade `kubelet` and `kubectl`

After upgrading the control plane, update `kubelet` and `kubectl` to match the control plane version.

```bash
# replace <node-to-drain> with the name of your node you are draining
kubectl drain <node-to-drain> --ignore-daemonsets
```

```bash
# Unhold kubelet and kubectl to allow version changes
sudo apt-mark unhold kubelet kubectl

# Update package lists and install the desired versions
sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install -y kubelet=1.30.0-00 kubectl=1.30.0-00

# Hold kubelet and kubectl at the current versions
sudo apt-mark hold kubelet kubectl

# Restart kubelet to apply changes
sudo systemctl restart kubelet

# Verify kubelet version
kubectl version --short
```

```bash
# replace <node-to-uncordon> with the name of your node
kubectl uncordon <node-to-uncordon>
```

> **📌 Reference:** [Upgrading kubeadm, kubelet, and kubectl](https://v1-29.docs.kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/administer-cluster/kubeadm/kubeadm-upgrade/)
>
> **ℹ️ Tip:** Repeat these steps for each Master Node in the Cluster **one by one** to ensure high availability.

### 6. Uncordon the Node (if it not taints)

After the upgrade, make the node schedulable again.

```bash
kubectl uncordon <node-name>
```

### 7. Verify Control Plane Components

Ensure that all control plane components are functioning correctly.

```bash
kubectl get nodes
kubectl get pods -n kube-system -o wide
kubectl version --short
```

> **📌 Reference:** [Checking Cluster Status](https://v1-29.docs.kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/administer-cluster/kubeadm/kubeadm-upgrade/)

## 🔧 **Upgrade Worker Nodes**

**Note:** Always upgrade worker nodes one at a time to maintain cluster stability.

### 1. Drain the Node (if it not taints)

Prepare the worker node for maintenance by draining it. This will safely evict all pods from the node and mark it as unschedulables

```bash
kubectl drain <node-name> --ignore-daemonsets --delete-emptydir-data
```

### 2. Upgrade `kubeadm`

Begin by upgrading `kubeadm` on the control plane node.

```bash
# Unhold kubeadm to allow version changes
sudo apt-mark unhold kubeadm

# Update package lists and install the desired kubeadm version
sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install -y kubeadm=1.30.0-00

# Hold kubeadm at the current version to prevent automatic upgrades
sudo apt-mark hold kubeadm
```

> **📌 Note:** Replace `1.30.0-00` with the specific version you intend to upgrade to (e.g., `1.30.5-00`).

### 3. Apply the Upgrade

```bash
sudo kubeadm upgrade node
```

### 4. Upgrade `kubeadm`, `kubelet`, and `kubectl`

Upgrade the Kubernetes components on the worker node.

```bash
# Unhold kubeadm, kubelet, and kubectl to allow version changes
sudo apt-mark unhold kubeadm kubelet kubectl

# Update package lists and install the desired versions
sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install -y kubeadm=1.30.0-00 kubelet=1.30.0-00 kubectl=1.30.0-00

# Hold kubeadm, kubelet, and kubectl at the current versions
sudo apt-mark hold kubeadm kubelet kubectl

# Restart kubelet to apply changes
sudo systemctl restart kubelet

# Verify kubelet version
kubectl version --short
```

> **📌 Note:** Replace `1.30.0-00` with the specific version you intend to upgrade to (e.g., `1.30.5-00`).

### 5. Uncordon the Node

After the upgrade, make the node schedulable again.

```bash
kubectl uncordon <node-name>
```

> **📝 Tip:** Replace `<node-name>` with the actual name of your worker node.

> **📝 Tip:** Repeat these steps for each Worker Node in the Cluster **one by one** to maintain cluster stability.

## ✅ **Post-Upgrade Tasks**

### 1. Verify Cluster Health

Ensure that all nodes are in a `Ready` state and that all pods are running as expected.

```bash
kubectl get nodes
kubectl get pods --all-namespaces
```

### 2. Update Helm Repository and Upgrade Charts

Update your Helm repositories and upgrade any Helm-managed applications to ensure compatibility with the new Kubernetes version.

```bash
# Update Helm repositories
helm repo update

# Upgrade Helm releases
helm upgrade <release-name> <chart> --version <new-version>
```

> **📝 Tip:** Replace `<release-name>`, `<chart>`, and `<new-version>` with your specific Helm release details.

### 3. Ensure Applications are Functioning Correctly

- **🔍 Action:** Check application logs for any issues.
- **📈 Action:** Monitor application performance and stability.

### 4. Review Deprecated APIs

Identify and address any deprecated APIs that may affect your workloads.

```bash
kubectl deprecations
```

> **📌 Reference:** [Deprecations and Removals](https://v1-29.docs.kubernetes.io/docs/reference/using-api/deprecation-policy/)

### 5. Update Deprecated API Versions in Your Manifests

Modify your Kubernetes manifests to use supported API versions to prevent future issues.

- **🔄 Action:** Update your YAML manifests to replace deprecated API versions with their current alternatives.

## 🔄 **Rolling Back (If Needed)**

> **⚠️ Disclaimer:** Rolling back a Kubernetes upgrade is **not officially supported** and can lead to cluster instability, data loss, or other critical issues. Proceed with caution and ensure you have comprehensive backups.

### 1. Restore `etcd` Backup

If you encounter critical issues, restore the `etcd` snapshot taken during pre-upgrade preparation.

```bash
ETCDCTL_API=3 etcdctl snapshot restore /path/to/backup.db \
  --data-dir=/var/lib/etcd
```

> **📌 Note:** Ensure that the `etcd` service is stopped before restoring.

### 2. Reinstall Previous Kubernetes Version

Revert to the previous Kubernetes version by reinstalling `kubeadm`, `kubelet`, and `kubectl`.

```bash
# Update package lists
sudo apt-get update

# Install previous versions of kubeadm, kubelet, and kubectl
sudo apt-get install -y \
  kubeadm=1.29.0-00 \
  kubelet=1.29.0-00 \
  kubectl=1.29.0-00

# Hold the packages to prevent automatic upgrades
sudo apt-mark hold kubeadm kubelet kubectl

# Restart kubelet to apply changes
sudo systemctl restart kubelet
```

> **📝 Tip:** Replace `1.29.0-00` with the specific version number you wish to revert to.

## ⭐ **Additional Best Practices**

1. **📈 Monitor Cluster Logs:**

   - Use tools like **Prometheus** and **Grafana** to monitor the health and performance of the cluster during and after the upgrade.

2. **🤖 Automate Upgrades:**

   - Consider using automation scripts or third-party tools to streamline the upgrade process.

3. **📝 Document the Upgrade Process:**

   - Keep detailed records of each upgrade step, including any issues encountered and their resolutions.

4. **🛡️ Implement Version Control for Configurations:**
   - Manage cluster configurations using version control systems like Git to track changes and facilitate rollbacks.

## ℹ️ **Notes**

### **1. Drain vs Cordon**

**Cordon** and **Drain** are Kubernetes commands used to prepare nodes for maintenance, but they serve different purposes:

- **🚫 Cordon:**

  - **Action:** Marks a node as unschedulable.
  - **Effect:** Prevents new pods from being scheduled on the node.
  - **Use Case:** When you want to stop new workloads from being placed on a node without affecting existing pods.

  ```bash
  kubectl cordon <node-name>
  ```

- **🚿 Drain:**

  - **Action:** Marks the node as unschedulable and evicts all running pods.
  - **Effect:** Moves existing pods to other nodes, ensuring the node is free for maintenance.
  - **Use Case:** When you need to perform maintenance that requires the node to be completely free of workloads.

  ```bash
  kubectl drain <node-name> --ignore-daemonsets --delete-emptydir-data
  ```

### **2. Drain Works Only with Pods Managed by a ReplicaSet**

- **📦 Managed Pods:**

  - **Definition:** Pods that are controlled by a ReplicaSet, Deployment, StatefulSet, etc.
  - **Behavior:** These pods will be automatically rescheduled on other nodes when drained.

- **🖐️ Unmanaged Pods:**

  - **Definition:** Pods not controlled by any higher-level controller (e.g., standalone pods).
  - **Behavior:** The `drain` command will not evict these pods. You must manually delete or handle them.

  > **📝 Tip:** Ensure that all critical pods are managed by appropriate controllers to facilitate smooth draining and maintenance.

### **3. Upgrade Path Considerations**

- **🔄 Supported Upgrade Paths:**

  - Kubernetes typically supports upgrades from one minor version to the next (e.g., 1.29 → 1.30).
  - Upgrading across multiple minor versions may require sequential upgrades.
