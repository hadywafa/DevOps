# Controllers Types inside `kube-controller-manager`

The `kube-controller-manager` in Kubernetes is a component that runs a collection of controllers responsible for maintaining the desired state of the cluster. Each controller manages different aspects of the cluster's operation. Here is a list of the key controllers that typically run inside the `kube-controller-manager`:

These controllers work together to maintain the desired state of the cluster, ensure high availability, and automate routine tasks, allowing Kubernetes to efficiently manage applications at scale.

## Controllers Types

### **1. Deployment Controller**

- Manages the lifecycle of Deployments, handling the creation of ReplicaSets and ensuring rolling updates and rollbacks.

### **2. ReplicaSet Controller**

- Manages ReplicaSets, ensuring that the specified number of Pod replicas are running.

### **3. StatefulSet Controller**

- Manages StatefulSets, ensuring that Pods are deployed in a specific order and maintaining persistent identities for stateful applications.

### **4. DaemonSet Controller**

- Ensures that a copy of a Pod is running on specified nodes (e.g., running a logging agent on every node).

### **5. Job Controller**

- Manages Jobs, ensuring that a specified number of tasks are completed successfully.

### **6. CronJob Controller**

- Manages CronJobs, which run jobs on a schedule.

### **7. Endpoints Controller**

- Populates the Endpoints object (a list of IPs that belong to a Service) whenever the set of Pods for a Service changes.

### **8. Service Account and Token Controllers**

- Manages the creation of default ServiceAccounts and associated API tokens in new namespaces.

### **9. Node Controller**

- Monitors the health of nodes and performs actions like marking nodes as unavailable when they stop responding.

### **10. Persistent Volume (PV) and Persistent Volume Claim (PVC) Controllers**

- Manages the lifecycle of PersistentVolumes and PersistentVolumeClaims, including binding and recycling.

### **11. ResourceQuota Controller**

- Ensures that resource usage for namespaces does not exceed the defined quotas.

### **12. Namespace Controller**

- Handles namespace lifecycle events, such as cleanup of resources in a namespace upon deletion.

### **13. Service Controller**

- Manages the lifecycle of Services and associated cloud provider load balancers.

### **14. Horizontal Pod Autoscaler Controller**

- Automatically adjusts the number of Pods in a replication controller, deployment, or replica set based on observed CPU or other resource metrics.

### **15. Garbage Collector**

- Cleans up resources that are no longer needed, such as orphaned Pods or ReplicaSets that are no longer referenced by a Deployment.

### **16. Certificate Signing Request (CSR) Controller**

- Manages the lifecycle of certificate signing requests in the cluster.

### **17. TTL Controller**

- Manages the time-to-live (TTL) for specific resources, such as finished Jobs and failed Pods.

### **18. Cloud Node Controller**

- Handles node lifecycle events in cloud environments, such as ensuring that nodes are correctly registered with the cloud provider.

### **19. Cloud Route Controller**

- Configures routes in the cloud provider’s networking to ensure that Kubernetes Pods can communicate across nodes.

### **20. Volume Snapshot Controller**

- Manages the creation, deletion, and updating of volume snapshots.

## Deployment Controller vs ReplicaSet Controller

Yes, you’ve got the overall process correct, but let me clarify and organize the steps a bit more clearly:

### 1. **Deployment Creation**

- **Deployment Controller**:
  - When you create a Deployment using `kubectl`, the Deployment Controller in the `kube-controller-manager` takes responsibility for managing this Deployment.
  - The Deployment Controller ensures that a corresponding ReplicaSet is created or updated to match the desired state of the Deployment.
  - This ReplicaSet object is stored in `etcd`, the key-value store used by Kubernetes to maintain cluster state.

### 2. **ReplicaSet Management**

- **ReplicaSet Controller**:
  - The ReplicaSet Controller is responsible for maintaining the number of Pod replicas specified in the ReplicaSet.
  - If the desired number of Pods (replicas) is not running, the ReplicaSet Controller creates or deletes Pods to reach the desired count.
  - To create new Pods, the ReplicaSet Controller makes a POST request to the Kubernetes API server, specifying the Pod template defined in the ReplicaSet.

### 3. **Pod Creation Process**

- **API Server**:

  - The API server receives the request to create new Pods and stores the Pod objects in `etcd`.

- **Scheduler**:

  - The Kubernetes Scheduler picks up these Pods and decides on which nodes they should run, based on resource availability and other scheduling policies.

- **Kubelet on Nodes**:

  - Once the Scheduler assigns a Pod to a specific node, the Kubelet on that node is responsible for creating and managing the Pod.
  - The Kubelet interacts with the **Container Runtime Interface (CRI)** to pull the necessary container images and create the containers within the Pod.

### 4. **Network Setup**

- **Container Network Interface (CNI)**:
  - The CNI plugin on the node sets up networking for the new Pod. This includes creating virtual network interfaces (veth pairs) and connecting the Pod to the cluster’s network.
  - The Pod’s network namespace is configured, and routes are set up to ensure communication with other Pods and services in the cluster.

### 5. **Pod Initialization**

- **Kubelet Final Steps**:
  - The Kubelet continuously monitors the status of the Pod and reports it back to the API server.
  - Once the Pod is up and running, its status is updated in `etcd` to reflect that it is active.

### Summary

- **Deployment Controller**: Manages Deployments and ensures the corresponding ReplicaSet exists and is up-to-date.
- **ReplicaSet Controller**: Responsible for maintaining the correct number of Pods as specified by the ReplicaSet. It creates Pods by making requests to the API server.
- **Kubelet**: Handles the actual creation of Pods on the assigned nodes, working with the CRI to launch containers and the CNI to configure networking.
- **etcd**: Stores the state of Deployments, ReplicaSets, and Pods, ensuring that the cluster state is consistent.

So, in short, the **ReplicaSet Controller** is responsible for creating and managing the Pods that fulfill the desired state of a Deployment, and it works in concert with the API server, Scheduler, Kubelet, and network plugins to bring the Pods into a running state within the cluster.
