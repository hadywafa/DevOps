# Deep Dive into Kubernetes (K8s) Services

**Kubernetes services** are an abstraction that defines a logical set of Pods and a policy by which to access them. Services provide stable endpoints to interact with applications inside and outside the cluster, despite Pods being ephemeral and their IPs potentially changing. Kubernetes services enable decoupling between clients and the underlying Pods.

In this deep dive, we'll cover:

1. **What a Service is and Why it's Important**.
2. **How Kubernetes Services Work**.
3. **Types of Kubernetes Services**:
   - ClusterIP (default)
   - NodePort
   - LoadBalancer
   - ExternalName
4. **Service Discovery in Kubernetes**.
5. **Configuring Services with YAML**.
6. **Related Commands for Services**.

## 1. **What is a Kubernetes Service?**

A **Service** in Kubernetes is an abstraction that provides a stable IP address or DNS name to access a dynamic set of Pods. Since Pods in Kubernetes can be ephemeral (created, destroyed, or rescheduled), their IP addresses can change. A Service allows clients to communicate with Pods without needing to track the individual Pod IPs.

**Key concepts of a Service**:

- **Selectors**: A Service uses label selectors to identify the Pods it should route traffic to.
- **Endpoints**: When a Service selects Pods based on labels, the selected Pods are grouped as endpoints for the Service.
- **Stable IP/DNS**: The Service gets a consistent virtual IP (ClusterIP) or DNS name that doesn’t change even if the Pods change.

## 2. **How Kubernetes Services Work**

Services work with **IPTables** or **IPVS** to route traffic to the appropriate Pods. When traffic reaches the Service IP, it’s redirected to one of the backend Pods (typically using round-robin load balancing).

### **Service IP Allocation**

- **ClusterIP**: Every Service in the cluster gets a ClusterIP from a virtual network managed by Kubernetes.
- **Endpoints Controller**: Kubernetes ensures that the endpoints list of the Service is updated as Pods are added or removed.

## 3. **Types of Kubernetes Services**

There are four main types of Services in Kubernetes:

### a. **ClusterIP (Default)**

- **Use Case**: For internal communication within the cluster.
- **Description**: This Service type exposes the service on a cluster-internal IP. It makes the service accessible only from within the cluster (other Pods).
- **Default behavior**: If no type is specified in the Service YAML, Kubernetes creates a `ClusterIP` service.

**Example: ClusterIP Service YAML**:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: my-clusterip-service
spec:
  selector:
    app: my-app
  ports:
    - protocol: TCP
      port: 80 # Port to access the service
      targetPort: 8080 # Port the container listens on
```

In the above example, the service exposes the app internally on port 80 and forwards traffic to the Pods on port 8080.

### b. **NodePort**

- **Use Case**: For exposing a service on each node’s IP at a static port.
- **Description**: This Service type makes the service accessible externally by exposing a port on each node. It forwards traffic from `<NodeIP>:<NodePort>` to the service inside the cluster.
- **Limitations**: You have to manage which NodePort range is available (by default between 30000-32767).

**Example: NodePort Service YAML**:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: my-nodeport-service
spec:
  type: NodePort
  selector:
    app: my-app
  ports:
    - protocol: TCP
      port: 80 # Port for the service
      targetPort: 8080 # Pod’s port
      nodePort: 32000 # Optional: If not specified, a random port between 30000-32767 is assigned
```

The service can now be accessed at `http://<NodeIP>:32000`.

### c. **LoadBalancer**

- **Use Case**: For exposing the service to external networks (commonly used in cloud environments).
- **Description**: This Service type automatically provisions a load balancer from the cloud provider (such as AWS, GCP, Azure). It directs traffic from the load balancer to the backend Pods.
- **Requirement**: Requires a cloud provider to set up a load balancer.

**Example: LoadBalancer Service YAML**:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: my-loadbalancer-service
spec:
  type: LoadBalancer
  selector:
    app: my-app
  ports:
    - protocol: TCP
      port: 80
      targetPort: 8080
```

In this case, Kubernetes will provision a cloud load balancer that forwards traffic to your service on port 80.

### d. **ExternalName**

- **Use Case**: For pointing to an external service (e.g., a database or API hosted outside the Kubernetes cluster).
- **Description**: This Service type maps a Kubernetes service to a DNS name outside the cluster.
- **Behavior**: The service does not define any Pods or endpoints and is used only for DNS resolution.

**Example: ExternalName Service YAML**:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: external-db-service
spec:
  type: ExternalName
  externalName: db.external-service.com
```

This service allows Pods to use `external-db-service` to resolve the external DNS name `db.external-service.com`.

## 4. **Service Discovery in Kubernetes**

Kubernetes provides two primary mechanisms for service discovery:

### a. **DNS-Based Service Discovery**

Kubernetes automatically configures the cluster DNS to resolve service names to the service’s ClusterIP. Every service gets a DNS entry following this pattern:

- **`<service-name>.<namespace>.svc.cluster.local`**: This allows Pods in other namespaces to reach services by their full name.

For example:

```bash
curl http://my-app.default.svc.cluster.local
```

### b. **Environment Variables**

When a Pod is created, Kubernetes injects environment variables that provide information about services. These variables follow the pattern:

- **`<SERVICE_NAME>_SERVICE_HOST`**
- **`<SERVICE_NAME>_SERVICE_PORT`**

## 5. **Configuring Services with YAML**

The basic structure of a Service YAML file includes:

- **`apiVersion`**: Defines the version of the Kubernetes API.
- **`kind`**: Always set to `Service`.
- **`metadata`**: Contains the name and labels of the Service.
- **`spec`**: Contains the specification, including selector labels and ports.

### Example: General Service YAML

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: my-service
spec:
  selector:
    app: my-app
  ports:
    - protocol: TCP
      port: 80
      targetPort: 8080
```

In this case:

- The Service listens on port 80.
- Traffic is forwarded to Pods that match the `app=my-app` label.
- The target port in the Pods is `8080`.

## 6. **Kubernetes Service Commands**

Here are some useful commands related to Services:

### a. **Create a Service**

You can create a Service using the `kubectl expose` command.

```bash
kubectl expose deployment <deployment-name> \
--name=<service-name> \
--type=ClusterIP \
--port=80 \
--target-port=8080 \
--selector=app=my-app \
--namespace=<namespace> \
--dry-run=client -o yaml > <service-name>.yaml
```

### b. **Get Services**

To list all Services in a namespace:

```bash
kubectl get services
```

To view Services across all namespaces:

```bash
kubectl get services --all-namespaces
```

### c. **Describe a Service**

This command provides detailed information about a Service, including endpoints and selectors:

```bash
kubectl describe service <service-name>
```

### d. **Delete a Service**

To delete a Service:

```bash
kubectl delete service <service-name>
```

#### e. **Inspect Endpoints**

To see which Pods are endpoints of a Service:

```bash
kubectl get endpoints <service-name>
```

## 7. **Common Scenarios with Services**

### **Scenario 1: Exposing a Web Application Using a NodePort**

You have a deployment for a web app, and you want to expose it outside the cluster using a fixed port:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: webapp-service
spec:
  type: NodePort
  selector:
    app: webapp
  ports:
    - port: 80
      targetPort: 8080
      nodePort: 30001
```

Access it at `http://<NodeIP>:30001`.

### **Scenario 2: Internal Communication Between Services**

You have multiple services that need to communicate internally within the cluster:

- `frontend-service`
- `backend-service`

Both can communicate using their service names:

```bash
curl http://backend-service
```

### **Scenario 3: Exposing an External Database via ExternalName**

You have an external database hosted outside Kubernetes, and you want your Pods to use a service name to access it.

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: external-db
spec:
  type: ExternalName
  externalName: db.example.com
```

Pods can now access the external database as `http://external-db`.

## Notes

`if service port not specified in the question => make it same as target port (pod port)`

## 8. **Conclusion**

Kubernetes Services are a powerful abstraction that simplify managing traffic to dynamic sets of Pods. They ensure that applications can be exposed both internally and externally while abstracting away the complexity of managing individual Pod IPs. With different types of Services like **ClusterIP**, **NodePort**, **LoadBalancer**, and **ExternalName**, you have flexibility in how traffic is routed inside and outside the Kubernetes cluster.

Understanding how Services work, the different types, and how to configure them properly is critical for maintaining robust and scalable applications in Kubernetes.
