# Kubernetes Authorization

Authorization in Kubernetes is the process of determining whether a user (or service account) has the necessary permissions to perform a specific action on a given resource within the cluster. After authentication, Kubernetes uses various authorization mechanisms to decide if the user is allowed to perform the requested action.


## Key Concepts

1. **Subjects**:

   - Entities that perform actions within the cluster.
   - Examples: Users, Groups, Service Accounts.

2. **Actions**:

   - Operations that a subject can perform on resources.
   - Examples: `get`, `list`, `create`, `update`, `delete`.

3. **Resources**:

   - Kubernetes objects or API resources that actions are performed on.
   - Examples: Pods, Deployments, Services.

4. **Non-resource URLs**:
   - Non-resource endpoints like `/api`, `/healthz` that can also be authorized.

## Authorization Methods

Kubernetes supports multiple authorization mechanisms, which can be used together:

### 1. **RBAC (Role-Based Access Control)**

- **Roles and ClusterRoles**: Define a set of permissions.
  - `Role`: Applies to a specific namespace.
  - `ClusterRole`: Applies cluster-wide.
- **RoleBindings and ClusterRoleBindings**: Bind a `Role` or `ClusterRole` to a user, group, or service account, granting the defined permissions.

**Example:**

```yaml
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: Role
metadata:
  namespace: default
  name: pod-reader
rules:
  - apiGroups: [""]
    resources: ["pods"]
    verbs: ["get", "list"]
```

**RoleBinding:**

```yaml
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: RoleBinding
metadata:
  name: read-pods
  namespace: default
subjects:
  - kind: User
    name: jane
    apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
roleRef:
  kind: Role
  name: pod-reader
  apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
```

### 2. **ABAC (Attribute-Based Access Control)**

- Allows fine-grained access control based on user attributes, resource attributes, and action attributes.
- Policies are defined in JSON files and evaluated at runtime.

**Example:**

```json
{ "user": "alice", "namespace": "default", "resource": "pods", "verb": "get" }
```

- This policy allows the user `alice` to `get` Pods in the `default` namespace.

### 3. **Webhook Mode**

- A custom authorization mode where an external service (webhook) determines if a request should be allowed.
- The webhook server implements a specific API and returns a decision (allow/deny) for each request.

**Example Configuration:**

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Config
clusters:
  - name: webhook
    cluster:
      server: "https://authz-webhook.example.com/authorize"
users:
  - name: webhook
contexts:
  - context:
      cluster: webhook
      user: webhook
    name: webhook
```

### 4. **Node Authorization**

- A special-purpose authorization mode that restricts what Kubernetes Nodes can do.
- Nodes are only allowed to modify resources related to their own Pods.

## Authorization Workflow

1. **Request Submission**:

   - A user or service submits a request to the Kubernetes API server.

2. **Authentication**:

   - The API server authenticates the user.

3. **Authorization Check**:

   - The API server checks if the user is authorized to perform the requested action using the configured authorization mechanisms (e.g., RBAC, ABAC).

4. **Decision**:
   - **Allow**: If authorized, the action is permitted.
   - **Deny**: If not authorized, the request is denied with a `403 Forbidden` response.

## Common Authorization Scenarios

1. **Creating a Pod**:

   - Requires permission on the `pods` resource with the `create` verb.

2. **Listing Services**:

   - Requires permission on the `services` resource with the `list` verb.

3. **Deleting a ConfigMap**:
   - Requires permission on the `configmaps` resource with the `delete` verb.

## Verifying Authorization

Kubernetes provides a command to check whether a specific action is authorized for a user:

```bash
kubectl auth can-i <verb> <resource> --namespace=<namespace>
```

**Example:**

```bash
kubectl auth can-i create pods --namespace=default
```

- This command will return `yes` or `no` depending on whether the user is authorized to create Pods in the `default` namespace.

## Conclusion

Authorization in Kubernetes is a critical security component that ensures users and services only have access to the resources and operations necessary for their role. RBAC is the most commonly used authorization mechanism due to its flexibility and ease of use. However, Kubernetes also supports other models like ABAC and Webhook for more complex or custom scenarios.
