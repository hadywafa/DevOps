# Final Exam Notes

## CKAD Exams Failure Questions

Sure! Hereâ€™s how the question might look on your CKA exam, along with a complete answer.

### Q1 (Docker Images)

#### **Question**

You have been provided a Dockerfile in the `/root/app` directory.

1. Build the Docker image with the tag `myapp:latest`.
2. Export the built image in **OCI format** and save it as `/root/myapp-oci.tar`.

Make sure the image is built and saved correctly.

#### **Answer**

1. **Navigate to the directory with the Dockerfile:**

   ```bash
   cd /root/app
   ```

2. **Build the Docker image:**

   ```bash
   docker build -t myapp:latest .
   ```

3. **Verify the image is built successfully (optional):**

   ```bash
   docker images | grep myapp
   ```

   You should see an entry similar to:

   ```ini
   myapp    latest    <image_id>    <created_time>    <size>
   ```

4. **Export the image in OCI format:**

   ```bash
   docker save --format oci -o /root/myapp-oci.tar myapp:latest
   ```

5. **Verify the OCI export (optional):**

   ```bash
   ls -lh /root/myapp-oci.tar
   ```

   You should see the file `/root/myapp-oci.tar` with the correct size.

#### **Explanation**

- **`docker build -t myapp:latest .`**: Builds the Docker image from the Dockerfile in the current directory and tags it as `myapp:latest`.
- **`docker save --format oci`**: Exports the image in **OCI format** to ensure compatibility with OCI-compliant tools and runtimes.
- **Optional steps** are included for verification to help ensure everything is working as expected.

This approach ensures you have correctly completed the image creation and export as per the exam requirements.

### Q2 (CronJobs)

#### **Question**

1. Create a **Kubernetes CronJob** that:

   - Runs **every 2 minutes**.
   - Keeps **2 successful jobs** and **3 failed jobs** in the history.
   - Never restarts the pod.
   - Terminates the job after **8 retries** on failure.

2. Additionally, create a **Job** from the same CronJob for testing purposes to ensure it works correctly.

#### **Answer**

##### Step 1: Create the CronJob YAML Manifest

Save the following content in `/root/cronjob.yaml`:

```yaml
apiVersion: batch/v1
kind: CronJob
metadata:
  name: example-cronjob
spec:
  schedule: "*/2 * * * *" # Runs every 2 minutes
  jobTemplate:
    spec:
      template:
        spec:
          restartPolicy: Never # Prevent restarts on failure
          containers:
            - name: example-container
              image: busybox
              command: ["sh", "-c", "echo Hello; exit 1"] # Simulates a failure
  successfulJobsHistoryLimit: 2 # Keep 2 successful jobs
  failedJobsHistoryLimit: 3 # Keep 3 failed jobs
  backoffLimit: 8 # Terminate after 8 failed attempts
```

##### Step 2: Apply the CronJob

```bash
kubectl apply -f /root/cronjob.yaml
```

##### Step 3: Verify the CronJob Creation

```bash
kubectl get cronjob example-cronjob
```

##### Step 4: Create a Job for Testing Purposes

To create a **Job** from the CronJob, you can extract the **Job template** from the CronJob manifest and apply it separately.

Create a new file `/root/test-job.yaml` with the following content:

```yaml
apiVersion: batch/v1
kind: Job
metadata:
  name: example-test-job
spec:
  template:
    spec:
      restartPolicy: Never # Ensure the pod doesn't restart
      containers:
        - name: example-container
          image: busybox
          command: ["sh", "-c", "echo Testing Job; exit 0"] # Simulate a successful job
  backoffLimit: 8 # Terminate after 8 retries if it fails
```

##### Step 5: Apply the Test Job

```bash
kubectl apply -f /root/test-job.yaml
```

##### Step 6: Verify the Job Execution

```bash
kubectl get jobs
```

You should see output similar to:

```ini
NAME               COMPLETIONS   DURATION   AGE
example-test-job   1/1           5s         1m
```

To inspect the pod logs:

```bash
kubectl logs -l job-name=example-test-job
```

This should display:

```ini
Testing Job
```

##### **Explanation**

1. **Creating a Job from a CronJob**:

   - The **CronJob's `jobTemplate`** defines the structure of the Job. You can copy it to create an independent Job for testing purposes.

2. **`restartPolicy: Never`**:

   - This ensures the pod won't restart upon failure.

3. **`backoffLimit: 8`**:
   - Limits the retries to **8 attempts** before the job is considered failed.
