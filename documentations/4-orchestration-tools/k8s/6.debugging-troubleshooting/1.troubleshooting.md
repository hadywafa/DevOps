## üêû Application Failure

**Application failures** occur when the deployed applications or services within the Kubernetes cluster do not function as expected. These issues can stem from misconfigurations, resource limitations, code-related bugs, or external dependencies.

### How to Find Problem

#### 1. Check Web Service

![alt text](images/check-service.png)

#### 2. Check Web Pod

![alt text](images/check-pod.png)

#### 3. Check Dependant Service

like database service

#### 4. Check Dependant pod

like database pod

### Common Causes

- **Pod CrashLoopBackOff:** Pods continuously crash and restart.
- **Image Pull Errors:** Kubernetes fails to pull the container image.
- **Resource Limits:** Containers exceed CPU or memory limits.

  ```bash
  kubectl describe pod <pod-name>
  ```

- **View Logs:**

  ```bash
  kubectl logs <pod-name>
  kubectl logs <pod-name> -c <container-name> # For multi-container pods
  ```

- **Check Previous Logs (for CrashLoopBackOff):**

  ```bash
  kubectl logs <pod-name> --previous
  ```

#### b. Check Events

- **List Events in the Namespace:**

  ```bash
  kubectl get events --sort-by=.metadata.creationTimestamp
  ```

- **Filter Events for Specific Pod:**

  ```bash
  kubectl describe pod <pod-name> | grep -i events -A 10
  ```

#### c. Validate Configuration

- **Review Deployment YAML:**
  Ensure that all configurations, such as environment variables, secrets, and config maps, are correctly set.

  ```bash
  kubectl get deployment <deployment-name> -o yaml
  ```

  Verify that resource requests and limits are appropriate.

  ```yaml
  resources:
    requests:
      memory: "64Mi"
      cpu: "250m"
    limits:
      memory: "128Mi"
      cpu: "500m"
  ```

#### d. Inspect Dependencies

- **Check Service Availability:**
  Ensure that dependent services like databases are up and accessible.

  ```bash
  kubectl get svc
  kubectl describe svc <service-name>
  ```

- **Test Connectivity:**
  Deploy a temporary pod to test connectivity.

  ```bash
  kubectl run tmp-shell --rm -i --tty --image=busybox -- /bin/sh
  # Inside the pod
  wget -qO- http://<dependency-service>:<port>
  ```

#### e. Examine Volume Mounts

- **Check Persistent Volume Claims (PVCs):**

  ```bash
  kubectl get pvc
  kubectl describe pvc <pvc-name>
  ```

- **Verify Volume Binding:**
  Ensure that volumes are correctly bound to pods.

  ```bash
  kubectl describe pod <pod-name> | grep -i volume
  ```

#### f. Analyze Probes

- **Check Probe Configuration:**
  Ensure that liveness and readiness probes are correctly configured.

  ```yaml
  livenessProbe:
    httpGet:
      path: /healthz
      port: 8080
    initialDelaySeconds: 3
    periodSeconds: 3
  readinessProbe:
    httpGet:
      path: /ready
      port: 8080
    initialDelaySeconds: 3
    periodSeconds: 3
  ```

- **Review Probe Failures:**

  ```bash
  kubectl describe pod <pod-name>
  ```

  - Use monitoring tools to detect hardware anomalies early.

## üåê Network Troubleshooting

Networking issues can prevent pods from communicating, disrupt service discovery, and affect external access to applications.

### How to Find Problem

#### Network Plugin in Kubernetes

There are several plugins available and these are some.

1. **Weave Net:**

   **To install:**

   ```bash
   kubectl apply -f https://github.com/weaveworks/weave/releases/download/v2.8.1/weave-daemonset-k8s.yaml
   ```

You can find details about the network plugins in the following documentation:

[Kubernetes Networking and Network Policy](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/cluster-administration/addons/#networking-and-network-policy)

1. **Flannel:**

   **To install:**

   ```bash
   kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/coreos/flannel/2140ac876ef134e0ed5af15c65e414cf26827915/Documentation/kube-flannel.yml
   ```

   **Note:** As of now, Flannel does not support Kubernetes network policies.

1. **Calico:**

   **To install:**

   ```bash
   curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/projectcalico/calico/v3.25.0/manifests/calico.yaml -O
   kubectl apply -f calico.yaml
   ```

   Calico is said to have the most advanced CNI network plugin.

   In the CKA and CKAD exams, you won't be asked to install the CNI plugin. But if asked, you will be provided with the exact URL to install it.

   **Note:** If there are multiple CNI configuration files in the directory, the kubelet uses the configuration file that comes first by name in lexicographic order.

#### DNS in Kubernetes

Kubernetes uses CoreDNS. CoreDNS is a flexible, extensible DNS server that can serve as the Kubernetes cluster DNS.

##### **Memory and Pods**

In large-scale Kubernetes clusters, CoreDNS's memory usage is predominantly affected by the number of Pods and Services in the cluster. Other factors include the size of the filled DNS answer cache and the rate of queries received (QPS) per CoreDNS instance.

Kubernetes resources for CoreDNS are:

- A service account named `coredns`
- ClusterRoles named `coredns` and `kube-dns`
- ClusterRoleBindings named `coredns` and `kube-dns`
- A deployment named `coredns`
- A ConfigMap named `coredns`
- A service named `kube-dns`

While analyzing the CoreDNS deployment, you can see that the Corefile plugin consists of important configuration which is defined as a ConfigMap.

Port 53 is used for DNS resolution.

```plaintext
kubernetes cluster.local in-addr.arpa ip6.arpa {
   pods insecure
   fallthrough in-addr.arpa ip6.arpa
   ttl 30
}
```

This is the backend to Kubernetes for `cluster.local` and reverse domains.

```plaintext
proxy . /etc/resolv.conf
```

Forward out-of-cluster domains directly to the right authoritative DNS server.

##### **Troubleshooting Issues Related to CoreDNS**

1. **CoreDNS Pods in Pending State**

   - First, check if the network plugin is installed.

2. **CoreDNS Pods Have CrashLoopBackOff or Error State**

   If you have nodes running SELinux with an older version of Docker, you might experience a scenario where the CoreDNS pods are not starting. To solve this, you can try one of the following options:

   1. **Upgrade to a newer version of Docker.**

   1. **Disable SELinux.**

   1. **Modify the CoreDNS deployment to set `allowPrivilegeEscalation` to true:**

      ```bash
      kubectl -n kube-system get deployment coredns -o yaml | \
          sed 's/allowPrivilegeEscalation: false/allowPrivilegeEscalation: true/g' | \
          kubectl apply -f -
      ```

   1. **Another Cause: CoreDNS Pod Detects a Loop**

   There are several ways to work around this issue:

   - **Update Kubelet Configuration:**

     Add the following to your kubelet config YAML:

     ```yaml
     resolvConf: <path-to-your-real-resolv-conf-file>
     ```

     This flag tells kubelet to pass an alternate `resolv.conf` to Pods. For systems using `systemd-resolved`, `/run/systemd/resolve/resolv.conf` is typically the location of the "real" `resolv.conf`, although this can vary depending on your distribution.

   - **Disable Local DNS Cache on Host Nodes:**

     Restore `/etc/resolv.conf` to the original state.

   - **Quick Fix: Edit Corefile**

     Replace `forward . /etc/resolv.conf` with the IP address of your upstream DNS, for example:

     ```plaintext
     forward . 8.8.8.8
     ```

     **Note:** This only fixes the issue for CoreDNS. Kubelet will continue to forward the invalid `resolv.conf` to all default `dnsPolicy` Pods, leaving them unable to resolve DNS.

3. **Check Kube-DNS Service Endpoints**

   If CoreDNS pods and the `kube-dns` service are working fine, check if the `kube-dns` service has valid endpoints:

   ```bash
   kubectl -n kube-system get ep kube-dns
   ```

   If there are no endpoints for the service, inspect the service and ensure it uses the correct selectors and ports.

#### Kube-Proxy

kube-proxy is a network proxy that runs on each node in the cluster. It maintains network rules on nodes, allowing network communication to the Pods from network sessions inside or outside of the cluster.

In a cluster configured with kubeadm, you can find kube-proxy as a DaemonSet.

kube-proxy is responsible for watching services and endpoints associated with each service. When a client connects to the service using the virtual IP, kube-proxy sends traffic to the actual Pods.

To view the kube-proxy configuration, run:

```bash
kubectl describe ds kube-proxy -n kube-system
```

You can see that the kube-proxy binary runs with the following command inside the kube-proxy container:

**Command:**

```bash
/usr/local/bin/kube-proxy
--config=/var/lib/kube-proxy/config.conf
--hostname-override=$(NODE_NAME)
```

This command fetches the configuration from the configuration file `/var/lib/kube-proxy/config.conf` and overrides the hostname with the node name where the pod is running.

In the config file, the following are defined:

- `clusterCIDR`
- kube-proxy mode (`ipvs`, `iptables`)
- `bindAddress`
- `kubeConfig`
- etc.

**Troubleshooting Issues Related to kube-proxy**

1. **Check if the kube-proxy Pod is Running:**

   ```bash
   kubectl get pods -n kube-system | grep kube-proxy
   ```

2. **Check kube-proxy Logs:**

   ```bash
   kubectl logs -n kube-system <kube-proxy-pod-name>
   ```

3. **Verify ConfigMap:**

   Ensure the ConfigMap is correctly defined and the configuration file for the kube-proxy binary is accurate.

4. **Check kubeConfig:**

   Ensure `kubeConfig` is defined in the ConfigMap.

5. **Verify kube-proxy is Running Inside the Container:**

   ```bash
   kubectl exec -n kube-system <kube-proxy-pod-name> -- netstat -plan | grep kube-proxy
   ```

   **Example Output:**

   ```plaintext
   tcp        0      0 0.0.0.0:30081           0.0.0.0:*               LISTEN      1/kube-proxy
   tcp        0      0 127.0.0.1:10249         0.0.0.0:*               LISTEN      1/kube-proxy
   tcp        0      0 172.17.0.12:33706       172.17.0.12:6443        ESTABLISHED 1/kube-proxy
   tcp6       0      0 :::10256                :::*                    LISTEN      1/kube-proxy
   ```
