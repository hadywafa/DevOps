# Debugging Methods in k8s

## 1. **Using Temporary Debugging Pods**

Sometimes, you need to debug a network issue or access a shell in the same namespace as your application pods. You can launch temporary pods like `busybox` or `alpine` for this purpose.

```bash
# to create a temporary busybox pod that runs for an hour and then exits but remains in the system
kubectl run busybox --image=busybox --restart=Never -- sleep 3600 # or --rm to remove the pod after exiting

# to enter the busybox pod
kubectl exec -it busybox -- sh

# to execute commands without entering the pod
kubectl exec busybox -- ping <service-name>
kubectl exec busybox -- nslookup <service-name>
kubectl exec busybox -- sh -c 'echo Hello, Kubernetes'
kubectl exec busybox -- sh -c "echo Hello, $USER"

# to create and entering the pod that automatically removed after exiting
kubectl run -it --rm busybox --image=busybox -- sh
```

## 2. **Debugging with Ephemeral Containers**

Kubernetes allows you to attach ephemeral containers to a running pod, which can be useful for debugging.

```bash
kubectl debug <pod-name> --image=busybox --target=<container-name>
```

This will create a new temporary container in the same pod, sharing the network and storage namespaces, allowing you to troubleshoot without affecting the running containers.

## 3. **Using `kubectl get` with `-o jsonpath`**

The `-o jsonpath` option allows you to extract specific fields from the output of a `kubectl get` command. This is especially useful for scripting or when you need to quickly find specific information without scrolling through large amounts of output.

```bash
# You can extract the IP addresses of all pods in a namespace:
kubectl get pods -n <namespace> -o jsonpath="{.items[*].status.podIP}"
```

```bash
# If you want to format the output more cleanly:
kubectl get pods -n <namespace> -o jsonpath="{range .items[*]}{.metadata.name}: {.status.podIP}{'\n'}{end}"
```

```bash
# To get the names of nodes where your deployment’s pods are running:
kubectl get pods -l app=<your-app-label> -o jsonpath="{range .items[*]}{.metadata.name} runs on {.spec.nodeName}{'\n'}{end}"
```

## 4. **Using `kubectl get` with `--custom-columns`**

The `--custom-columns` option allows you to define custom output columns for your `kubectl get` commands. This is useful for tailoring output to your specific needs.

```bash
# You can list pods with custom columns for the pod name, node name, and IP address:
kubectl get pods -o custom-columns="NAME:.metadata.name, NODE:.spec.nodeName, IP:.status.podIP"
```

```bash
# If you want to list nodes with their names and resource capacity:
kubectl get nodes -o custom-columns="NAME:.metadata.name, CPU:.status.capacity.cpu, MEMORY:.status.capacity.memory"
```

## 5. **Using `kubectl port-forward` for Local Access**

If you need to access an application running in your cluster from your local machine, `kubectl port-forward` is a handy tool.

```bash
# To access a service running on port 8080 inside your cluster, you can forward it to your local machine:
kubectl port-forward pod/<pod-name> 8080:8080
```

Now, you can access the application on `localhost:8080`.

## 6. **Checking Events and Logs**

Events and logs provide insights into what’s happening in your cluster, which can help in diagnosing issues.

### **Example: Checking Events**

You can get a list of recent events in your cluster:

```bash
kubectl get events --sort-by=.metadata.creationTimestamp
```

This is useful for understanding recent changes or issues in the cluster, like failed pod scheduling or network errors.

### **Example: Checking Logs of a Pod**

To check the logs of a specific container in a pod:

```bash
kubectl logs <pod-name> -c <container-name>
```

You can also stream logs in real-time with:

```bash
kubectl logs -f <pod-name> -c <container-name>
```

## Conclusion

These are just a few of the many tools and techniques available for debugging and troubleshooting in Kubernetes. Using commands like `kubectl get` with `jsonpath` or `custom-columns` allows for powerful, customized output, while temporary debugging pods like `busybox` offer a flexible environment for testing and diagnosing issues in real-time. By combining these tools with a systematic approach, you can effectively resolve issues in your Kubernetes clusters.
