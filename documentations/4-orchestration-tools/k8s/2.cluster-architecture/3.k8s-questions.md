## What is the difference between Deployment Controller and ReplicaSet Controller

### Deployment Controller

- **Role**: Overseer and Decision-Maker
- **Responsibilities**:
  - Watches the Deployment resource for any desired state changes (e.g., scaling up/down, updating the container image).
  - Makes decisions on what actions need to be taken to achieve the desired state.
  - Creates, updates, or deletes ReplicaSets as needed to match the Deployment's specifications.
  - Manages rolling updates and rollbacks by creating new ReplicaSets or updating existing ones.

### ReplicaSet Controller

- **Role**: Executor
- **Responsibilities**:
  - Watches the ReplicaSet resource.
  - Ensures that the specified number of pod replicas are running at all times.
  - If a pod managed by the ReplicaSet fails or is deleted, the ReplicaSet Controller creates a new pod to replace it.

### Interaction Between Deployment Controller and ReplicaSet Controller

1. **Deployment Creation**:
   - You create a Deployment specifying the desired state (e.g., 3 replicas of a web server).
   - The Deployment Controller sees this new Deployment and creates a corresponding ReplicaSet to match the desired state.

2. **Scaling**:
   - If you update the Deployment to scale the number of replicas from 3 to 5, the Deployment Controller detects this change.
   - The Deployment Controller updates the ReplicaSet to specify 5 replicas.
   - The ReplicaSet Controller sees this updated ReplicaSet and creates 2 additional pods to meet the new desired state of 5 replicas.

3. **Rolling Update**:
   - If you update the Deployment with a new container image, the Deployment Controller handles the rolling update process.
   - The Deployment Controller creates a new ReplicaSet with the updated container image.
   - The Deployment Controller gradually scales up the new ReplicaSet and scales down the old one to perform the rolling update.
   - The ReplicaSet Controller ensures the correct number of pods are running during this process, creating new pods from the new ReplicaSet and deleting old pods from the old ReplicaSet.

4. **Pod Failure**:
   - If a pod managed by the ReplicaSet fails, the ReplicaSet Controller detects this failure.
   - The ReplicaSet Controller creates a new pod to replace the failed one to maintain the desired number of replicas.

In summary, the **Deployment Controller** acts as the overseer and decision-maker, making high-level decisions based on the Deployment specifications. It delegates the task of ensuring the correct number of pod replicas to the **ReplicaSet Controller**, which acts as the executor, ensuring that the actual state matches the desired state by creating or deleting pods as necessary.

## How do controllers detect changes in the state of the cluster?

- Each Kubernetes controller subscribes to specific events from the API server.
- These events are triggered when actions such as creating, updating, or deleting pods occur, or when the system handles node failures.
- When a user makes changes to the configuration, the API server stores the new settings in etcd and then triggers relevant events.
- Other controllers in the cluster subscribe to these events and execute their respective logic to ensure that the cluster maintains its desired state.
