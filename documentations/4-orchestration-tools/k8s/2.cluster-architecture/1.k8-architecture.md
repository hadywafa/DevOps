## **1. Kubernetes Core Components**

### Master Node Components (Control Plane)

- **API Server (`kube-apiserver`):** Acts as the front-end for the Kubernetes control plane.
- **etcd:** Key-value store for all cluster data.
- **Scheduler (`kube-scheduler`):** Assigns pods to nodes.
- **Controller Manager (`kube-controller-manager`):** Manages controller processes.
- **Cloud Controller Manager:** Integrates with cloud service providers.

### Worker Node Components (Nodes)

- **Kubelet:** Node agent that ensures containers are running in a pod.
- **Kube-proxy:** Network proxy that maintains network rules on nodes.
- **Container Runtime:** Provides the necessary runtime to run containers.
- **Pod:** Smallest deployable unit that represents a single instance of a running process.

## **2. Workload Resources**

- **Pod:** The smallest deployable unit that can be created, managed, and deleted.
- **ReplicaSet:** Ensures a specified number of pod replicas are running at any given time.
- **Deployment:** Manages ReplicaSets and provides declarative updates to applications.
- **StatefulSet:** Manages stateful applications.
- **DaemonSet:** Ensures that all or some nodes run a copy of a pod.
- **Job and CronJob:** Manages batch and scheduled tasks.

## **3. Services and Networking**

- **Service:** Provides stable IP addresses and DNS names to pods.
- **Ingress:** Manages external access to services, usually HTTP.
- **Network Policies:** Controls the communication between pods.
- **DNS (CoreDNS):** Provides DNS services for the cluster.

## **4. Configuration and Storage**

- **ConfigMap:** Manages configuration data.
- **Secret:** Manages sensitive information like passwords and tokens.
- **PersistentVolume (PV) and PersistentVolumeClaim (PVC):** Manages storage resources.

## **5. Security and RBAC**

- **RBAC (Role-Based Access Control):** Manages permissions within the cluster.
- **ServiceAccount:** Provides an identity for processes that run in a pod.

## **6. Monitoring and Logging**

- **Metrics Server:** Collects resource usage data.
- **Logging:** Centralized logging for clusters.

## **7. Namespaces**

- **Namespaces:** Provides a mechanism to partition resources within a single cluster.

## **8. Helm**

- **Helm:** A package manager for Kubernetes, which helps in managing Kubernetes applications.

## **9. Cluster Maintenance and Operations**

- **kubectl:** Command-line tool for interacting with the Kubernetes API.
- **kubeadm:** Tool for bootstrapping a Kubernetes cluster.

## **10. Troubleshooting and Performance Tuning**

- **Debugging techniques:** Understanding common issues and solutions.
- **Performance tuning:** Techniques to optimize cluster performance.
