# **Service IP in Kubernetes**

When you create a Service in Kubernetes, it is assigned a **virtual IP address** known as the **ClusterIP**. This IP is stable and does not change even as Pods come and go. The Service IP is used to expose the Service within the cluster, and it abstracts away the details of which Pods are actually running the application.

Here’s what you need to know:

- **ClusterIP**: The internal IP address for a service, used by other Pods within the cluster to access the service.
- **How it’s assigned**: The IP is automatically assigned by the Kubernetes control plane from a pool of IPs designated for services.

## **Is the Service IP Stored on All Nodes?**

Yes, **every node** in the Kubernetes cluster knows about every Service IP. This is because the **Service IP** and associated routing information is propagated to all nodes.

### **How This Works:**

1. **Kubernetes Control Plane**: When a Service is created, the Kubernetes control plane assigns an IP address (the **ClusterIP**) to that Service and stores it in **etcd** (Kubernetes’ distributed key-value store).

2. **kube-proxy**:

   - On each node, a component called **kube-proxy** ensures that all traffic destined for the Service IP is routed to one of the Pods backing that Service.
   - **kube-proxy** configures **iptables** (or **IPVS**) rules on every node to map the Service IP to the appropriate backend Pods.

3. **iptables/IPVS**: Each node's **iptables** (or IPVS) rules store the Service IP and manage traffic routing to the appropriate Pods. So even if a Service's Pods are running on different nodes, any node in the cluster can route traffic to the Service.

### **Cluster-Wide Knowledge**:

- **Every node** in the cluster has knowledge of all Service IPs, even if no Pods backing that Service are running on a particular node.
- This is why you can access a Service from any Pod running on any node, regardless of which node the Service's Pods are running on.

## **Service IP Lifecycle**

1. **Service Creation**:

   - When you create a Service (e.g., a `ClusterIP` type service), Kubernetes assigns a **virtual IP address** from a pool of internal service IPs.

2. **Propagation to Nodes**:

   - **kube-proxy** on each node listens for changes in services and updates the node's routing tables (via `iptables` or `IPVS`) to ensure that traffic sent to the Service IP can be correctly forwarded to the backend Pods.

3. **Pod Selection**:

   - The Service selects Pods using a label selector. kube-proxy ensures that any traffic sent to the Service IP is routed to the selected Pods.

4. **Service Access**:
   - Other Pods within the cluster can access the Service by using the **Service IP** or the **DNS name** of the service.

## **How Traffic Routing Works**

When a Pod tries to connect to a Service IP:

1. **Pod Makes a Request**:

   - A Pod in the cluster makes a request to the Service IP (or the DNS name of the Service).

2. **kube-proxy Intercepts Traffic**:

   - The request hits the Service IP, and **kube-proxy** (on the same node as the Pod making the request) intercepts this traffic.

3. **Traffic Routing**:
   - kube-proxy routes the traffic to one of the Pods that back the Service. If multiple Pods are backing the Service, kube-proxy typically uses round-robin load balancing to distribute traffic across them.

## **ClusterIP Example**

Here’s an example of a Service YAML where a **ClusterIP** is assigned:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: my-service
spec:
  selector:
    app: my-app
  ports:
    - protocol: TCP
      port: 80 # Service Port
      targetPort: 8080 # Pod's Port
```

After creating this service, Kubernetes assigns a **ClusterIP**, which is internal to the cluster. You can check the Service IP by running:

```bash
kubectl get svc
```

This command will display the assigned **ClusterIP** for `my-service`, which can be accessed by other Pods within the cluster.

---

## **Accessing Services via ClusterIP**

- **Pods within the cluster** can use either the Service’s **ClusterIP** or its **DNS name** to access the Service.
- The **DNS name** of the Service follows the pattern:

  - `<service-name>.<namespace>.svc.cluster.local`

For example, if `my-service` is in the `default` namespace, Pods can access it via:

```bash
curl http://my-service.default.svc.cluster.local
```

---

## **How Does kube-proxy Manage Service IPs?**

- **kube-proxy** runs on every node in the Kubernetes cluster. It manages the Service IPs and ensures that traffic sent to a Service is correctly routed to the underlying Pods.
- It creates and manages the **iptables** rules (or uses **IPVS**) on each node to map each **Service IP** to the appropriate Pods’ IP addresses.

**Example of iptables rules for a Service**:

```bash
-A KUBE-SERVICES -d 10.96.0.10/32 -p tcp -m comment --comment "default/kubernetes:https cluster IP" -m tcp --dport 443 -j KUBE-SVC-NPX46M4PTMTKRN6Y
```

This rule ensures that traffic sent to the **ClusterIP** (`10.96.0.10`) is forwarded to the appropriate backend Pods.

## **Summary of Key Points**

1. **Service has a ClusterIP**:

   - Every Service (except ExternalName) is assigned a **ClusterIP**. This is the internal IP address that other Pods in the cluster can use to communicate with the Service.

2. **Service IP is stored across all nodes**:

   - Every node in the cluster knows about all Service IPs, and the traffic destined for any Service is handled by **kube-proxy**, which updates the node’s routing rules to handle that traffic.

3. **Service IP is internal**:
   - The **ClusterIP** is typically only accessible within the cluster unless you expose it externally (e.g., via NodePort or LoadBalancer).
