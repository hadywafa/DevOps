# Controllers Types inside `kube-controller-manager`

The `kube-controller-manager` in Kubernetes is a component that runs a collection of controllers responsible for maintaining the desired state of the cluster. Each controller manages different aspects of the cluster's operation. Here is a list of the key controllers that typically run inside the `kube-controller-manager`:

These controllers work together to maintain the desired state of the cluster, ensure high availability, and automate routine tasks, allowing Kubernetes to efficiently manage applications at scale.

## Controllers Types

### **1. Deployment Controller**

- Manages the lifecycle of Deployments, handling the creation of ReplicaSets and ensuring rolling updates and rollbacks.

### **2. ReplicaSet Controller**

- Manages ReplicaSets, ensuring that the specified number of Pod replicas are running.

### **3. StatefulSet Controller**

- Manages StatefulSets, ensuring that Pods are deployed in a specific order and maintaining persistent identities for stateful applications.

### **4. DaemonSet Controller**

- Ensures that a copy of a Pod is running on specified nodes (e.g., running a logging agent on every node).

### **5. Job Controller**

- Manages Jobs, ensuring that a specified number of tasks are completed successfully.

### **6. CronJob Controller**

- Manages CronJobs, which run jobs on a schedule.

### **7. Endpoints Controller**

- Populates the Endpoints object (a list of IPs that belong to a Service) whenever the set of Pods for a Service changes.

### **8. Service Account and Token Controllers**

- Manages the creation of default ServiceAccounts and associated API tokens in new namespaces.

### **9. Node Controller**

- Monitors the health of nodes and performs actions like marking nodes as unavailable when they stop responding.

### **10. Persistent Volume (PV) and Persistent Volume Claim (PVC) Controllers**

- Manages the lifecycle of PersistentVolumes and PersistentVolumeClaims, including binding and recycling.

### **11. ResourceQuota Controller**

- Ensures that resource usage for namespaces does not exceed the defined quotas.

### **12. Namespace Controller**

- Handles namespace lifecycle events, such as cleanup of resources in a namespace upon deletion.

### **13. Service Controller**

- Manages the lifecycle of Services and associated cloud provider load balancers.

### **14. Horizontal Pod Autoscaler Controller**

- Automatically adjusts the number of Pods in a replication controller, deployment, or replica set based on observed CPU or other resource metrics.

### **15. Garbage Collector**

- Cleans up resources that are no longer needed, such as orphaned Pods or ReplicaSets that are no longer referenced by a Deployment.

### **16. Certificate Signing Request (CSR) Controller**

- Manages the lifecycle of certificate signing requests in the cluster.

### **17. TTL Controller**

- Manages the time-to-live (TTL) for specific resources, such as finished Jobs and failed Pods.

### **18. Cloud Node Controller**

- Handles node lifecycle events in cloud environments, such as ensuring that nodes are correctly registered with the cloud provider.

### **19. Cloud Route Controller**

- Configures routes in the cloud providerâ€™s networking to ensure that Kubernetes Pods can communicate across nodes.

### **20. Volume Snapshot Controller**

- Manages the creation, deletion, and updating of volume snapshots.

## Workload

Workload resources in Kubernetes define the desired state and configuration of applications. They describe how applications should be deployed and managed, but they do not manage the applications themselves. Here are the key workload resources

### Interaction Between Workload Resources and Controllers

When you create a workload resource, you define the desired state of your application. The corresponding controller acts to ensure that the cluster's actual state matches this desired state. Here's how it works:

1. **Defining Desired State**: You create a workload resource (e.g., Deployment, StatefulSet) that specifies how your application should run.
2. **Controllers Act**: The appropriate controller (e.g., Deployment Controller) reads this specification and takes action to achieve the desired state.
   - For example, when you create a Deployment, the Deployment Controller ensures that the specified number of pod replicas are running by creating and managing a ReplicaSet.
3. **Managing Pods**: Controllers handle creating, updating, and deleting pods as needed to maintain the desired state.
   - If a pod fails or a node goes down, the controller creates new pods to replace the failed ones.

### Summary

- **Workload Resources**: Configurations that define the desired state of applications (e.g., Deployment, StatefulSet).
- **Controllers**: Control loops that manage the actual state to match the desired state (e.g., Deployment Controller, StatefulSet Controller).
