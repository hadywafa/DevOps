# K8s Service

In Kubernetes, a Service is an **object** that facilitates communication and access to a set of Pods. Here's a brief overview:

- It is a Kubernetes API object that defines a logical set of Pods and a policy to access them. It abstracts the underlying Pods and provides a stable endpoint for network communication.

- The Service object, like other Kubernetes objects, is stored in `etcd`, the distributed key-value store that holds the cluster's state. This allows Kubernetes to persist and manage the Service's configuration and status.

## **Purpose:**

- **Service Discovery:** Provides a stable DNS name and IP address to access a set of Pods, which can change dynamically.
- **Load Balancing:** Distributes traffic across the Pods that match the Service’s selector.
- **Networking:** Manages network rules and configurations to ensure that traffic is correctly routed to the appropriate Pods.

## **Types of Services:**

- **ClusterIP:** Exposes the Service on an internal IP address within the cluster (default type).
- **NodePort:** Exposes the Service on a static port on each node’s IP address, allowing external access.
- **LoadBalancer:** Creates an external load balancer (typically cloud provider-specific) to distribute traffic to the Service.
- **ExternalName:** Maps the Service to an external DNS name.
