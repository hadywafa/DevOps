# What is kube-scheduler?

The **kube-scheduler** is a crucial component of the Kubernetes control plane responsible for assigning Pods to nodes in the cluster. When a Pod is created (for example, by a Deployment or ReplicaSet), it initially remains in a "Pending" state until the scheduler assigns it to a suitable node.

## How kube-scheduler Works

The kube-scheduler performs its function in several steps:

1. **Monitoring the API Server:**

   - The kube-scheduler continuously watches the Kubernetes API server for newly created Pods that do not have an assigned node (i.e., they are in the "Pending" state).
   - These Pods are in the queue waiting to be scheduled.

2. **Filtering Nodes (Predicate Functions):**

   - The scheduler evaluates all available nodes to determine which ones are eligible to run the Pod. This process involves applying several "predicate functions" or filters, which check:
     - **Node Affinity/Anti-Affinity:** Whether the Pod has constraints on which nodes it can run based on labels.
     - **Taints and Tolerations:** Whether the Pod can tolerate any taints applied to nodes.
     - **Resource Requests and Limits:** Whether the node has enough available CPU, memory, and other resources to satisfy the Pod's requirements.
     - **Pod Affinity/Anti-Affinity:** Whether the Pod has preferences or restrictions about co-locating with other Pods.
     - **Node Unschedulable:** Whether the node is marked as unschedulable, perhaps due to maintenance or other reasons.
   - If a node passes all these filters, it becomes a candidate for scheduling the Pod.

3. **Scoring Nodes (Priority Functions):**

   - After filtering out ineligible nodes, the scheduler ranks the remaining nodes using "priority functions" or scoring rules. These scoring rules consider factors like:
     - **Resource Efficiency:** Preferring nodes that would efficiently utilize resources if the Pod were scheduled there.
     - **Pod Spreading:** Ensuring that Pods are evenly distributed across nodes or failure domains (such as availability zones).
     - **Load Balancing:** Considering the current load on nodes to avoid overloading any particular node.
   - Each node receives a score, and the scheduler selects the node with the highest score as the best fit for the Pod.

4. **Binding the Pod to a Node:**

   - Once a node is selected, the kube-scheduler issues a binding request to the API server. This binding process involves updating the Pod object to include the selected nodeâ€™s name.
   - The Pod's status is updated to reflect its new state, and it transitions from "Pending" to "Running" once it starts on the assigned node.

5. **Continuous Optimization:**
   - The scheduler continuously monitors the state of the cluster, rescheduling Pods if necessary due to node failures or changes in resource availability.
   - Although the basic scheduling process is fairly static, advanced configurations can involve dynamic scheduling policies, preemption (removing lower-priority Pods to make room for higher-priority ones), and custom schedulers for specific use cases.

## Key Concepts Related to kube-scheduler

- **Taints and Tolerations:** These mechanisms control which Pods can be scheduled on certain nodes. For example, a node might have a "NoSchedule" taint, preventing most Pods from being scheduled there unless they tolerate that taint.

- **Node Affinity and Anti-Affinity:** This allows you to control which nodes a Pod can be scheduled on based on node labels. For example, you might require that certain Pods only run on nodes with specific hardware characteristics or in certain geographic locations.

- **Pod Affinity and Anti-Affinity:** This lets you control where Pods are scheduled relative to other Pods. For instance, you might want Pods to be co-located on the same node for performance reasons or spread out across different nodes for resilience.

- **Custom Schedulers:** While the default kube-scheduler works for most scenarios, Kubernetes allows the creation of custom schedulers if you have specialized scheduling needs.

## Summary

The kube-scheduler is a core Kubernetes component responsible for deciding which nodes should run newly created Pods. It does this by filtering and scoring nodes based on the Pods' requirements and the cluster's current state. The scheduler ensures that Pods are distributed across the cluster efficiently, considering resource constraints, affinity rules, and other factors to maintain balance and optimize resource usage.
