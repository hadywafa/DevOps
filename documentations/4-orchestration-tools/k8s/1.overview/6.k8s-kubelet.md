# What is Kubelet?

The **Kubelet** is a core component of Kubernetes that runs on every node in the cluster. It acts as an agent responsible for managing the lifecycle of Pods on its node, ensuring that the containers are running as expected according to the specifications provided by the Kubernetes control plane.

## Key Responsibilities of Kubelet

1. **Pod Management:**
   - The Kubelet is responsible for ensuring that the containers described in the Pod specifications are running and healthy. It does this by:
     - **Monitoring the API Server:** The Kubelet continuously watches the API server for any Pods assigned to its node.
     - **Pod Creation:** When a new Pod is scheduled on its node, the Kubelet interacts with the container runtime to start the containers in the Pod.
     - **Pod Deletion:** It also handles the termination of Pods, ensuring that containers are properly shut down.

2. **Interacting with Container Runtime:**
   - The Kubelet interfaces with the **Container Runtime Interface (CRI)**, which is an abstraction layer that allows Kubernetes to work with different container runtimes (e.g., Docker, containerd, CRI-O).
   - **Image Pulling:** The Kubelet instructs the container runtime to pull the required container images from a container registry.
   - **Container Execution:** It then manages the lifecycle of these containers, including starting, stopping, and restarting them as needed.

3. **Networking and Storage:**
   - **Networking:** The Kubelet works with the **Container Network Interface (CNI)** plugins to set up networking for Pods. This includes creating network interfaces, setting up IP addresses, and ensuring that Pods can communicate within the cluster.
   - **Storage:** It manages the mounting and unmounting of volumes specified in the Pod definitions, ensuring that the necessary storage resources are available to the containers.

4. **Health Monitoring and Probing:**
   - **Liveness and Readiness Probes:** The Kubelet performs health checks on running containers using liveness and readiness probes defined in the Pod specification.
     - **Liveness Probes:** Determine if the container is alive and should be restarted if it fails.
     - **Readiness Probes:** Determine if the container is ready to serve traffic.
   - Based on these probes, the Kubelet can restart containers, mark them as unready, or take other actions to maintain the desired state.

5. **Status Reporting:**
   - The Kubelet continuously reports the status of Pods and containers back to the API server. This status information is stored in `etcd` and is used by other components, like controllers, to make decisions.
   - **Node Status:** The Kubelet also reports the health and status of the node itself, including resource utilization (CPU, memory, disk space).

6. **Syncing Desired State with Actual State:**
   - The Kubelet works to ensure that the actual state of the node matches the desired state as specified by the Kubernetes control plane.
   - If a container crashes or a Pod is not running as expected, the Kubelet will attempt to bring the system back to the desired state by restarting containers or reporting issues.

7. **Logging and Metrics Collection:**
   - The Kubelet collects logs and metrics from the running containers and Pods. It can integrate with logging and monitoring systems (e.g., Fluentd, Prometheus) to provide observability for the cluster.
   - **Metrics Server:** The Kubelet exposes metrics about resource usage on the node, which can be used for autoscaling and monitoring.

## Summary

- The **Kubelet** is a critical component of Kubernetes that runs on each node in the cluster.
- It manages the lifecycle of Pods, interacting with the container runtime to start and stop containers, setting up networking, and managing storage.
- The Kubelet also performs health checks, reports status back to the control plane, and ensures that the node's actual state matches the desired state defined by the control plane.
- Through its various responsibilities, the Kubelet plays a central role in maintaining the stability, performance, and reliability of a Kubernetes cluster.
