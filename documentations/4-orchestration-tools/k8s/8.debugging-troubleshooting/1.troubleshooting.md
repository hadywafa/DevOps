# Debugging and troubleshooting in Kubernetes (K8s)

## **Understanding the Kubernetes Architecture**

Before diving into troubleshooting, it's important to understand the basic components of Kubernetes:

- **Pods:** The smallest deployable units in K8s, typically hosting one or more containers.
- **Nodes:** The machines (VMs or physical servers) where your pods run.
- **Cluster:** A set of nodes managed by a control plane.
- **Control Plane Components:**
  - **API Server:** The gateway for accessing the Kubernetes API.
  - **Scheduler:** Assigns pods to nodes based on resource availability.
  - **Controller Manager:** Handles node management, pod replication, and more.
  - **etcd:** The key-value store for all cluster data.
- **Networking:** Involves CNI plugins, Services, Ingress controllers, etc.

## **Common Issues in Kubernetes**

Some common issues you might encounter include:

- **Pods not starting or crashing repeatedly (CrashLoopBackOff).**
- **Service not accessible (networking issues).**
- **Persistent Volumes (PV) not mounting.**
- **High resource utilization leading to throttling or OOM (Out Of Memory) errors.**
- **Failed deployments or updates (image pull issues, readiness/liveness probe failures).**

## **Debugging Tools in Kubernetes**

Kubernetes provides several built-in commands and tools for debugging:

- **`kubectl describe`:** Gives detailed information about a resource.
- **`kubectl logs`:** Fetches logs from a specific container within a pod.
- **`kubectl exec`:** Executes a command inside a running container.
- **`kubectl get`:** Retrieves information about resources, often used with wide output (`-o wide`).
- **`kubectl top`:** Shows resource usage (CPU, memory) of nodes or pods.
- **Events and logs**: Captures the state of resources and helps identify issues.

## **Debugging Pods and Containers**

### **Scenario 1: Pod Not Starting**

Let's say you deployed a pod, but it isn't starting. You might see an error like `CrashLoopBackOff`.

1. **Check Pod Status:**

   ```bash
   kubectl get pods
   ```

   Look for pods that are not in the `Running` state.

2. **Describe the Pod:**

   ```bash
   kubectl describe pod <pod-name>
   ```

   This command provides detailed information, including events, reasons for failure, and the status of containers.

3. **Check Container Logs:**

   ```bash
   kubectl logs <pod-name> -c <container-name>
   ```

   If the pod has multiple containers, specify the container with `-c`. Logs can show errors such as misconfigurations or application-level issues.

4. **Execute Commands Inside the Container:**
   If the container is running but something is not working as expected:

   ```bash
   kubectl exec -it <pod-name> -- /bin/sh
   ```

   This allows you to get a shell inside the container to inspect the environment, check configuration files, or run diagnostic commands like `curl`, `ping`, or `nslookup`.

#### **Example: Image Pull Issues**

If a pod fails to start because Kubernetes cannot pull the image, you might see an event like:

```plaintext
Failed to pull image "my-app:latest": rpc error: code = Unknown desc = Error response from daemon: pull access denied for my-app, repository does not exist or may require 'docker login'
```

**Steps to Resolve:**

- Verify the image name and tag.
- Check if the image is available in the registry.
- Ensure you have the correct Docker credentials (create a Kubernetes secret for private registries).

## **Debugging Networking Issues**

### **Scenario 2: Service Not Accessible**

Let’s say a service is not accessible from other pods or from outside the cluster.

1. **Check Service Configuration:**

   ```bash
   kubectl get svc
   kubectl describe svc <service-name>
   ```

   Ensure that the service is correctly configured and that the correct ports are exposed.

2. **Check Pod Connectivity:**
   Use `kubectl exec` to run networking tools like `curl` or `wget` inside a pod:

   ```bash
   kubectl exec -it <pod-name> -- curl http://<service-name>:<port>
   ```

   This helps verify if the service is reachable from within the cluster.

3. **Verify DNS Resolution:**
   Kubernetes uses a DNS service to resolve service names to IP addresses.

   ```bash
   kubectl exec -it <pod-name> -- nslookup <service-name>
   ```

   If DNS is not working, check the CoreDNS pods in the `kube-system` namespace:

   ```bash
   kubectl get pods -n kube-system | grep coredns
   ```

4. **Check Network Policies:**
   If you're using Network Policies, ensure that they are not blocking the traffic:

   ```bash
   kubectl get networkpolicy
   kubectl describe networkpolicy <policy-name>
   ```

   Example: If a frontend pod can't reach the backend service, check if there is a policy restricting the traffic.

## **Debugging Persistent Volume Issues**

### **Scenario 3: Persistent Volume Not Mounting**

1. **Check the PVC Status:**

   ```bash
   kubectl get pvc
   kubectl describe pvc <pvc-name>
   ```

   Ensure the PVC is bound to a PV.

2. **Inspect the Events:**
   The `describe` output usually contains events that indicate why the volume couldn't be mounted, such as access issues or storage class misconfigurations.

3. **Check Pod Events:**
   If a pod cannot start because it can't mount the volume:

   ```bash
   kubectl describe pod <pod-name>
   ```

   Look for events related to volume mounts.

4. **Common Fixes:**
   - Ensure the underlying storage provider (EBS, GCE, NFS) is functioning properly.
   - Verify that the PV and PVC specifications match (e.g., access modes, storage class).
   - If using dynamic provisioning, check if the storage class exists and is configured correctly.

## **Resource Usage Troubleshooting**

### **Scenario 4: High Resource Utilization**

If your pods or nodes are experiencing high CPU or memory usage:

1. **Check Resource Usage:**

   ```bash
   kubectl top pods
   kubectl top nodes
   ```

   This shows you which pods or nodes are consuming the most resources.

2. **Inspect Pod Resource Requests and Limits:**

   ```bash
   kubectl describe pod <pod-name>
   ```

   Ensure that your pods have appropriate resource requests and limits set. If not, they might consume more resources than expected, leading to throttling or OOM errors.

3. **Adjust Requests and Limits:**
   If necessary, update your deployments or statefulsets to adjust the resource requests and limits.

4. **Check Node Capacity:**
   Ensure your nodes have sufficient capacity. If a node is consistently running out of resources, consider adding more nodes to the cluster or scaling down workloads.

## **Troubleshooting Deployment Issues**

### **Scenario 5: Failed Deployment or Rollout**

1. **Check Deployment Status:**

   ```bash
   kubectl get deployments
   kubectl describe deployment <deployment-name>
   ```

2. **Check for Rollout Issues:**

   ```bash
   kubectl rollout status deployment <deployment-name>
   ```

   This command helps you understand if there’s an issue with the deployment process, like a failed rollout.

3. **Review ReplicaSet and Pods:**
   If a deployment is failing, inspect the ReplicaSets and pods associated with it:

   ```bash
   kubectl get rs
   kubectl describe rs <replicaset-name>
   kubectl get pods --show-labels
   ```

4. **Roll Back a Deployment:**
   If a deployment is problematic, you can roll it back to the previous version:

   ```bash
   kubectl rollout undo deployment <deployment-name>
   ```

## **Logs and Events**

- **Check Logs Continuously:**
  For continuous monitoring, you can use:

  ```bash
  kubectl logs -f <pod-name> -c <container-name>
  ```

- **Events:**
  Kubernetes events provide useful insights into what’s happening in the cluster. Check events for a particular resource:

  ```bash
  kubectl get events --sort-by=.metadata.creationTimestamp
  ```

## **Advanced Troubleshooting with Debug Containers**

Sometimes, you might want to troubleshoot using tools that are not available in your container images. Kubernetes allows you to attach a debug container with different tools to an existing pod:

```bash
kubectl debug <pod-name> --image=busybox --target=<container-name>
```

This creates a new ephemeral container in the pod that shares the same namespaces, making it useful for network debugging, file inspection, etc.

## Conclusion

Troubleshooting in Kubernetes involves a systematic approach to identify, diagnose, and resolve issues in a distributed system. By understanding the architecture, utilizing built-in tools like `kubectl`, and following best practices for logging, resource management, and network configuration, you can effectively debug issues in your Kubernetes environment.

Remember, each issue might require a combination of techniques, and over time, you’ll develop a more intuitive sense for where to look when

things go wrong.
