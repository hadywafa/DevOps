# Resource Requests and Limits

Resource requests and limits are essential in Kubernetes for managing resources like CPU and memory. Resource requests ensure that containers are guaranteed a specific amount of resources, while resource limits define the maximum amount of resources a container can utilize. These mechanisms play a crucial role in resource allocation and optimization within Kubernetes clusters.

## Setting Resource Requests and Limits

Resource requests and limits are set in the container specification of a pod. The following fields are used to define resource requests and limits:

- `resources.requests.cpu`: The amount of CPU requested by the container.
- `resources.requests.memory`: The amount of memory requested by the container.
- `resources.limits.cpu`: The maximum amount of CPU the container can use.
- `resources.limits.memory`: The maximum amount of memory the container can use.

## Example

```yaml
# resource-requests-limits.yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod

metadata:
  name: resource-requests-limits
  namespace: default

spec:
  containers:
    - name: main-container
      image: nginx:1.20
      resources:
        requests:
          memory: "64Mi"
          cpu: "250m"
        limits:
          memory: "128Mi"
          cpu: "500m"
```

In this example, the container `main-container` has the following resource requests and limits:

- Requests:

  - Memory: 64Mi (Mi => MiB => mebibyte => megabyte => 1024^2 bytes)
  - CPU: 250m (m => millicore => 0.25 CPU cores)

- Limits:
  - Memory: 128Mi (Mi => MiB => mebibyte => megabyte => 1024^2 bytes)
  - CPU: 500m (m => millicore => 0.25 CPU cores)
