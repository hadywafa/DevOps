# Self Sign Certificates

## For App in VM

To create and trust self-signed certificates on Ubuntu and Windows 11, you'll need to perform a few steps for each operating system. Here's a guide for both.

### Creating Self-Signed Certificates

#### Using OpenSSL

1. **Generate a Private Key:**

   ```sh
   openssl genrsa -out rootCA.key 2048
   ```

2. **Generate a Root Certificate:**

   ```sh
   openssl req -x509 -new -nodes -key rootCA.key -sha256 -days 1024 -out rootCA.pem
   ```

3. **Create a Certificate Signing Request (CSR):**

   ```sh
   openssl req -new -key rootCA.key -out server.csr
   ```

4. **Generate a Certificate using the CSR and Root Certificate:**

   ```sh
   openssl x509 -req -in server.csr -CA rootCA.pem -CAkey rootCA.key -CAcreateserial -out server.crt -days 500 -sha256
   ```

### Trusting the Self-Signed Certificate

#### Ubuntu

1. **Move the `rootCA.pem` to the trusted certificate directory:**

   ```sh
   sudo cp rootCA.pem /usr/local/share/ca-certificates/
   ```

2. **Update the certificate store:**

   ```sh
   sudo update-ca-certificates
   ```

3. **Verify the certificate is trusted:**

   ```sh
   openssl verify -CAfile /usr/local/share/ca-certificates/rootCA.pem server.crt
   ```

#### Windows 11

1. **Open the Microsoft Management Console (MMC):**
   - Press `Win + R`, type `mmc`, and press `Enter`.

2. **Add the Certificates Snap-in:**
   - In the MMC window, go to `File > Add/Remove Snap-in...`.
   - Select `Certificates` from the list, click `Add >`.
   - Choose `Computer account`, click `Next`, then `Finish`, and `OK`.

3. **Import the Certificate:**
   - In the left pane, expand `Certificates (Local Computer) > Trusted Root Certification Authorities > Certificates`.
   - Right-click `Certificates`, choose `All Tasks > Import...`.
   - Follow the wizard to import your `rootCA.pem` file.

4. **Verify in Chrome:**
   - Open Chrome, type `chrome://settings/security` in the address bar, and press `Enter`.
   - Click `Manage certificates` under `Advanced`.
   - Ensure your certificate is listed under `Trusted Root Certification Authorities`.

### Conclusion

By following these steps, you will create a self-signed certificate and ensure that it is trusted by both Ubuntu and Windows 11. This will allow you to open websites using this certificate in Chrome without any security warnings.
