# Multi Container in Pod

A pod in Kubernetes can have multiple containers running within it, sharing the same network and storage. These containers are managed as a single entity, scheduled and running on the same node. They can be utilized to implement various patterns such as sidecar, adapter, and ambassador. Additionally Init Containers can be used to perform tasks before the main container starts.

## patterns

### 1. Sidecar Pattern

The sidecar pattern is a container that runs alongside the main application container, providing additional functionality. The sidecar container can be used for logging, monitoring, health checks, and other tasks that are not part of the main application. The sidecar container can be used to extend the functionality of the main application without modifying it.

#### Example

```yaml
# sidecar-pattern.yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: backend
  namespace: default
spec:
  containers:
    - name: main-container
      image: nginx:1.20
      ports:
        - containerPort: 80
    - name: sidecar-container
      image: busybox:1.28
      command: ["sh", "-c", "while true; do echo sync app logs; sleep 20; done"]
```

```bash
# Apply the configuration
kubectl apply -f sidecar-pattern.yaml
# Check the status of the pod
kubectl get pods
# Check the logs of the sidecar container
kubectl logs backend -c sidecar-container
# Access the shell of the sidecar container
kubectl exec -it backend -c sidecar-container -- sh
```

### 2. Adapter Pattern

The adapter pattern is a container that acts as an interface between the main application container and the external world. The adapter container can be used to translate data formats, protocols, or APIs between the main application and external services. The adapter container can be used to integrate the main application with external services without modifying it.

### 3. Ambassador Pattern

The ambassador pattern is a container that acts as a proxy server or reverse proxy for the main application container. The ambassador container can be used to route traffic, load balance requests, or cache responses between the main application and external services. The ambassador container can be used to provide additional functionality to the main application without modifying it.

## Init Container

An init container is a container that runs before the main container in a pod. It can be used to perform tasks such as setting up environment variables, downloading configuration files, or waiting for other services to be ready. The init container runs to completion before the main container starts. If the init container fails, the pod will not start.

apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: init-container
spec:
    containers:
    - name: main-container
        image: nginx:1.20
        ports:
        - containerPort: 80
    initContainers:
    - name: init-container
        image: busybox:1.28
        command: ['sh', '-c', 'until nslookup my-db-service; do echo waiting for my-db-service; sleep 4; done']
```
