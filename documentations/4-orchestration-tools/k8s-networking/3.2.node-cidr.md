## 1. **Who Manages Node CIDR Allocation and How**

### **Definition**

- **Node CIDR**: The IP address range assigned to the **nodes** (physical or virtual machines) in your Kubernetes cluster. This range determines the IPs that nodes can have within the cluster's network.

### **Responsibility**

- **Underlying Network Infrastructure**: The allocation of Node CIDR is **not directly managed by Kubernetes**. Instead, it's handled by the **underlying network infrastructure** where your cluster is deployed. This could be:
  - **Cloud Providers** (e.g., AWS, GCP, Azure)
  - **On-Premises Networks**
  - **Custom Networking Solutions**

### **Management Based on Deployment Environment**

- **Managed By**: Underlying network infrastructure (Cloud Providers, On-Premises Networks, Custom Solutions).
- **How**: Through VPC/Subnet configurations in cloud environments or network setups in on-premises deployments.

## 2. **How to Get Node CIDR**

### **Use `kubectl`**

```bash
kubectl get nodes -o wide
```

#### Infer CIDR from node IPs

- From the `INTERNAL-IP` addresses, deduce the CIDR.
  - **Example**: If node IPs are `192.168.1.10`, `192.168.1.11`, etc., the Node CIDR is likely `192.168.1.0/24`.
- From 'ip addr show | grep 'INTERNAL-IP''

### **Check Cloud Provider Settings**:

- **GKE**: VPC > Subnets in Google Cloud Console or `gcloud` CLI.
- **EKS**: VPC > Subnets in AWS Console or `aws` CLI.
- **AKS**: Virtual Networks > Subnets in Azure Portal or `az` CLI.

### **On-Premises**

- Inspect node network interfaces or consult network documentation.

## 3. **How to Update Node CIDR**

- **Cloud Providers**:
  - **Typically Immutable**: Often require creating a new cluster with the desired CIDR.
  - **Alternative Methods**: Use secondary IP ranges or CNI plugin configurations where supported.
- **On-Premises/Custom**:
  - **Reconfigure Network Settings**: Update DHCP/static IPs and Kubernetes network configurations.
  - **Careful Planning**: Ensure minimal disruption and thorough testing.
