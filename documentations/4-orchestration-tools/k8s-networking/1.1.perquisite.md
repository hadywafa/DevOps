# Perquisite

To understand how VXLAN works and how containers in different nodes communicate, here are the prerequisites and a simplified explanation:

1. **LAN (Local Area Network):**

   - **Brief:** Basic networking within a local area. Understand Ethernet and basic network communication.
   - **Relation to k8s Networking:** Forms the foundation for understanding how Kubernetes operates on a local network.

2. **SDN (Software-Defined Networking):**

   - **Brief:** Network virtualization and centralized control. SDN separates network control from data forwarding.
   - **Relation to k8s Networking:** Provides the foundation for network abstraction and dynamic management in Kubernetes.

3. **VXLAN (Virtual Extensible LAN):**

   - **Brief:** Overlay network technology using UDP to encapsulate Ethernet frames. Supports large-scale virtual networks.
   - **Relation to k8s Networking:** Used in Kubernetes to create scalable and isolated virtual networks across nodes.

4. **BGP (Border Gateway Protocol):**

   - **Brief:** Inter-domain routing protocol used to exchange routing information between networks.
   - **Relation to k8s Networking:** Works with EVPN to distribute routing information for VXLAN segments.

5. **EVPN (Ethernet VPN):**

   - **Brief:** Provides a control plane for VXLAN, enabling dynamic and scalable network virtualization using BGP.
   - **Relation to k8s Networking:** Manages VXLAN overlays in Kubernetes, enabling scalable and dynamic network configurations.

6. **Gossip Protocol:**

   - **Brief:** A protocol for distributed systems that uses periodic updates and randomness to disseminate information across nodes.
   - **Relation to k8s Networking:** Used in some Kubernetes networking solutions (e.g., for service discovery or cluster coordination) to manage and disseminate network information across a distributed cluster.

7. **IP-in-IP Protocol:**
   - **Brief:** Encapsulates IP packets within other IP packets. Provides a way to transport packets across networks with different IP addressing.
   - **Relation to k8s Networking:** Used in some Kubernetes networking solutions for encapsulating packets within IP headers, often for implementing overlay networks.

## Relationships:

- **LAN:** Provides the physical network layer where Kubernetes operates.
- **SDN:** Adds abstraction and control over the network, allowing Kubernetes to manage and configure network policies.
- **VXLAN:** Creates overlay networks on top of the LAN, enabling scalable virtual networks in Kubernetes.
- **BGP:** Distributes routing information for VXLAN segments, ensuring proper routing across the network.
- **EVPN:** Acts as the control plane for VXLAN, enabling dynamic network provisioning and management.
- **Gossip Protocol:** Helps in disseminating network information and maintaining cluster coordination in distributed Kubernetes environments.
- **IP-in-IP Protocol:** Provides a method for encapsulating packets, useful in certain Kubernetes networking scenarios for handling packet transport across different network boundaries.

This order and understanding of how these protocols and technologies interrelate will give you a comprehensive grasp of Kubernetes networking and its underlying mechanisms.
