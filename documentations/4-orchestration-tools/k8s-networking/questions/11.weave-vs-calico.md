# Weave vs Calico

Weave and Calico are both popular CNI (Container Network Interface) plugins for Kubernetes, but they have different design philosophies, features, and limitations. Here’s a comparison focusing on Weave’s limitations relative to Calico:

## 1. Performance

- **Weave:**
  - **Overhead:** Weave uses a user-space process for packet encapsulation, which can introduce additional overhead compared to kernel-based solutions like Calico. This can result in slightly higher CPU usage and potentially lower throughput, especially in high-traffic environments.
  - **Latency:** The additional encapsulation and decapsulation steps in Weave can introduce some latency, particularly in large clusters or when there is heavy inter-node communication.
- **Calico:**
  - **Native Routing:** Calico uses native Linux kernel routing and, in some configurations, BGP (Border Gateway Protocol) for networking. This approach can offer better performance, especially in terms of throughput and latency, because it avoids the overhead of overlay networks.

## 2. Scalability

### Scalability Across Different VLANs

- **Weave:**

  - **Encapsulation and Routing:** Weave uses its overlay network, encapsulating Layer 2 Ethernet frames into UDP packets that are routed over the Layer 3 network. This allows Weave to bridge different VLANs and make it appear as if all nodes are on the same Layer 2 network.
  - **Gossip Protocol:** Weave relies on a gossip protocol for distributing network information, which can become less efficient as the network grows. When scaling across different VLANs, the increased network traffic for gossip updates can become a bottleneck.
  - **Simplicity:** Weave’s simplicity can be an advantage in small to medium deployments, but in larger setups with multiple VLANs, it may struggle with performance and scalability due to its reliance on user-space processing and gossip protocols.

- **Calico:**
  - **Native L3 Routing:** Calico’s native Layer 3 routing capabilities allow it to efficiently route traffic between nodes on different VLANs without the need for encapsulation. This is particularly advantageous when scaling across multiple VLANs, as Calico can leverage existing network infrastructure without adding overhead.
  - **BGP for Routing:** Calico uses BGP (Border Gateway Protocol) to exchange routing information between nodes. This is more scalable than Weave’s gossip protocol and is designed to handle large-scale, complex networks with multiple VLANs. BGP can also be configured to work across VLAN boundaries, making it a robust solution for multi-VLAN environments.
  - **Flexibility and Control:** Calico’s network policies and IPAM (IP Address Management) offer more control in multi-VLAN environments, allowing for fine-grained configuration and efficient IP management across different network segments.

### Scalability Across Different ISPs

- **Weave:**

  - **Overlay Network Over Public Internet:** Weave’s ability to create an overlay network allows it to span across different ISPs by encapsulating traffic in UDP packets. However, this approach can be challenging due to latency, network reliability, and potential security concerns when dealing with public internet connections.
  - **Encryption:** Weave provides built-in encryption, which is essential when traffic needs to traverse the public internet. However, the added encryption and encapsulation can introduce performance overhead, particularly in large, geographically distributed clusters.
  - **Potential Bottlenecks:** The gossip protocol, combined with the need for encapsulation over potentially high-latency, low-bandwidth ISP links, can limit Weave’s effectiveness in large-scale, multi-ISP deployments. The performance and reliability of the Weave overlay network may degrade as the number of nodes and the complexity of the network increase.

- **Calico:**
  - **Efficient Routing Across ISPs:** Calico’s ability to use BGP and native IP routing makes it more suitable for scenarios where nodes are distributed across different ISPs. BGP can handle complex routing across different ASNs (Autonomous System Numbers) used by ISPs, ensuring efficient path selection and traffic routing.
  - **Cloud and Hybrid Support:** Calico integrates well with cloud environments and hybrid setups, where different parts of the cluster might be hosted on different ISPs or even across cloud providers. Calico can leverage the underlying network infrastructure of these environments, reducing the need for overlay networks.
  - **Security and Policies:** Calico’s advanced network policies and security features allow you to enforce strict controls over how traffic is routed between nodes across different ISPs. This is crucial for maintaining security and compliance in a multi-ISP setup.

### Considerations for Multi-VLAN and Multi-ISP Deployments

- **Network Latency and Bandwidth:**

  - **Weave:** Weave’s performance can be affected by high latency and low bandwidth links, especially in multi-ISP scenarios. The encapsulation overhead and the need for frequent gossip updates can lead to increased latency and reduced throughput.
  - **Calico:** Calico’s use of native routing and BGP allows it to better handle varying network conditions, making it more resilient to latency and bandwidth fluctuations.

- **Network Complexity:**

  - **Weave:** Weave is easier to set up but may struggle with complexity as the network grows, especially when dealing with multiple VLANs or ISPs.
  - **Calico:** Calico is more complex to configure but offers better scalability and performance in complex network topologies, including those spanning multiple VLANs or ISPs.

- **Security:**
  - **Weave:** Weave’s built-in encryption is an advantage for securing traffic over public networks, but it may not offer the same level of policy control and segmentation as Calico.
  - **Calico:** Calico’s robust security policies, combined with its ability to work with existing network security infrastructure (like firewalls and cloud security groups), make it more suitable for secure, large-scale deployments across different network environments.

### Conclusion

**Weave** is a good choice for smaller, simpler Kubernetes deployments, especially where ease of use and simplicity are priorities. However, as the network grows in complexity—particularly when nodes are spread across different VLANs or ISPs—**Calico** becomes the more appropriate choice. **Calico’s** scalability, performance, and advanced networking features, like BGP integration and native Layer 3 routing, make it better suited for handling the challenges of multi-VLAN and multi-ISP deployments.
