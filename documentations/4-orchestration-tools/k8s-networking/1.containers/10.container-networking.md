# Container Networking

## Overview

### 1. Network Namespace

#### What is a Network Namespace?

A network namespace is a feature of the Linux kernel that provides isolated network environments within a single operating system instance. Each network namespace has its own network stack, including interfaces, IP addresses, routing tables, and firewall rules. This isolation allows containers to operate independently from each other and from the host system.

#### Key Features:

- **Isolation:** Each container gets its own network namespace, ensuring complete network separation from other containers and the host.
- **Independence:** Network configurations in one namespace do not affect those in another namespace.

### 2. Virtual Ethernet Interface (veth)

#### What is a Virtual Ethernet Interface?

A virtual Ethernet (veth) interface is a pair of connected network interfaces that act as a tunnel, passing data between two network namespaces. One end of the veth pair is placed in one network namespace, and the other end is placed in another namespace or in the host's namespace.

#### Key Features:

- **Paired Interfaces:** veth interfaces come in pairs. Traffic sent to one interface appears on the other, enabling communication between network namespaces.
- **Bridge Connection:** Typically, one end of a veth pair is connected to a bridge network, allowing multiple containers to communicate with each other and with the host.

### 3. How Docker Uses Network Namespaces and veth

#### Setup and Registrations:

1. **Host (PC):**

   - **IP Address:** 192.168.1.100
   - **Docker Engine:** Manages containers and their networking.

2. **Docker Bridge Network:**

   - **Subnet:** 172.17.0.0/16
   - **Gateway:** 172.17.0.1

3. **Containers:**
   - **Container1:** 172.17.0.2, isolated in its own network namespace.
   - **Container2:** 172.17.0.3, isolated in its own network namespace.

#### Components:

- **Bridge:** A virtual network switch (docker0 by default) that connects the veth interfaces.
- **veth Pair:** Connects the container's network namespace to the Docker bridge.

### 4. Workflow: Container to Internet

#### Step-by-Step Packet Flow

**Container to Internet:**

1. **Container1 to Docker Bridge:**

   - **Initial Packet:**
     ```plaintext
     Ethernet Header:
     Source MAC: [Container1 MAC]
     Destination MAC: [Bridge Gateway MAC]
     Type: 0x0800 (IPv4)
     IP Header:
     Source IP: 172.17.0.2
     Destination IP: 93.184.216.34 (Web Server)
     Protocol: TCP
     TTL: 64
     Checksum: [Calculated Value]
     TCP Header:
     Source Port: 12345
     Destination Port: 80
     Sequence Number: [Initial Sequence Number]
     Flags: [TCP Flags]
     Checksum: [Calculated Value]
     Payload: [HTTP GET Request]
     ```

2. **Container's Network Namespace:**

   - **veth0 (in Container1) to veth1 (in Docker Bridge Network Namespace):**
     - The packet is sent from veth0 (inside Container1) to veth1 (connected to the Docker bridge).

3. **Docker Bridge to Host (PC):**

   - **Docker Engine Handling:**
     - **NAT Translation:**
       - **Changes Source IP:** From container IP (172.17.0.2) to host IP (192.168.1.100).
       - **Stores Mapping:** Tracks the container IP and port to the host IP and port.
     - **Modified Packet:**
       ```plaintext
       Ethernet Header:
       Source MAC: [Host MAC]
       Destination MAC: [Router MAC]
       Type: 0x0800 (IPv4)
       IP Header:
       Source IP: 192.168.1.100
       Destination IP: 93.184.216.34 (Web Server)
       Protocol: TCP
       TTL: 63
       Checksum: [Recalculated Value]
       TCP Header:
       Source Port: [Host Port]
       Destination Port: 80
       Sequence Number: [Initial Sequence Number]
       Flags: [TCP Flags]
       Checksum: [Recalculated Value]
       Payload: [HTTP GET Request]
       ```

4. **Host to Internet:**
   - **Host to Router:**
     - Forwards the packet to the router.
   - **Router to Internet:**
     - Router forwards the packet to the web server.

### 5. Workflow: Internet to Container

**Internet to Container:**

1. **Web Server to Host (PC):**

   - **Initial Packet:**
     ```plaintext
     IP Header:
     Source IP: 93.184.216.34 (Web Server)
     Destination IP: 192.168.1.100 (Host)
     Protocol: TCP
     TTL: [Decremented Value]
     Checksum: [Calculated Value]
     TCP Header:
     Source Port: 80
     Destination Port: [Host Port]
     Sequence Number: [Sequence Number]
     Flags: [TCP Flags]
     Checksum: [Calculated Value]
     Payload: [HTTP Response Data]
     ```

2. **Host to Docker Bridge:**

   - **Docker Engine Handling:**
     - **Reverse NAT Translation:**
       - **Maps Destination IP and Port:** From host IP (192.168.1.100) and port to container IP (172.17.0.2) and port.
     - **Modified Packet:**
       ```plaintext
       Ethernet Header:
       Source MAC: [Bridge Gateway MAC]
       Destination MAC: [Container1 MAC]
       Type: 0x0800 (IPv4)
       IP Header:
       Source IP: 93.184.216.34 (Web Server)
       Destination IP: 172.17.0.2 (Container)
       Protocol: TCP
       TTL: [Decremented Value]
       Checksum: [Recalculated Value]
       TCP Header:
       Source Port: 80
       Destination Port: 12345
       Sequence Number: [Sequence Number]
       Flags: [TCP Flags]
       Checksum: [Recalculated Value]
       Payload: [HTTP Response Data]
       ```

3. **Docker Bridge to Container1:**
   - **veth1 (in Docker Bridge Network Namespace) to veth0 (in Container1):**
     - The packet is sent from veth1 (connected to the Docker bridge) to veth0 (inside Container1).
   - **Container1 receives the packet:**
     ```plaintext
     Ethernet Header:
     Source MAC: [Bridge Gateway MAC]
     Destination MAC: [Container1 MAC]
     Type: 0x0800 (IPv4)
     IP Header:
     Source IP: 93.184.216.34 (Web Server)
     Destination IP: 172.17.0.2 (Container)
     Protocol: TCP
     TTL: [Decremented Value]
     Checksum: [Recalculated Value]
     TCP Header:
     Source Port: 80
     Destination Port: 12345
     Sequence Number: [Sequence Number]
     Flags: [TCP Flags]
     Checksum: [Recalculated Value]
     Payload: [HTTP Response Data]
     ```

### Key Concepts Explained:

1. **Network Namespace:**

   - Each container has its own network namespace, providing isolation.
   - Changes in one namespace do not affect other namespaces or the host.

2. **Virtual Ethernet (veth) Interface:**

   - **veth Pair:** Connects network namespaces. One end is inside the container's namespace (veth0), and the other end is in the host's namespace or a bridge (veth1).
   - **Bridge Connection:** veth1 interfaces are typically connected to a Docker bridge, allowing multiple containers to communicate.

3. **Docker Bridge Network:**

   - Acts as a virtual switch, connecting containers and the host.
   - Provides IP addresses to containers and manages internal traffic.

4. **NAT (Network Address Translation):**
   - **Outbound Traffic:** Docker engine translates container IPs to the host IP for communication with external networks.
   - **Inbound Traffic:** Reverse NAT maps incoming traffic from the host IP back to the appropriate container IP.

### Summary:

- **Network Namespace:** Isolates network configurations for each container, ensuring complete network isolation.
- **veth Interface:** Connects containers to the Docker bridge network, enabling communication with other containers and the host.
- **Docker Bridge Network:** Provides a virtual switch for internal container communication and routes traffic to/from the host.
- **NAT:** Allows containers to use the host's IP address for external communication, translating addresses as needed.

By understanding network namespaces and veth interfaces, you can see how Docker effectively isolates and manages container networks, enabling seamless communication within the containerized environment and with external networks.
