# Lifecycle of a Deployment and Its Pods in Kubernetes

Let's explore how a Deployment with two replicas creates Pods, how these Pods receive their IP addresses, and how they run on different worker nodes.

## **1. Creating a Deployment**

You start by defining a Deployment that specifies:

- **Name**: A unique identifier for the Deployment.
- **Replicas**: The number of Pod copies you want (in this case, 2).
- **Pod Template**: The specification for the Pods, including the container image.

### **Example Deployment YAML**

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: my-deployment
spec:
  replicas: 2 # Number of desired Pods
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: my-app
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: my-app # Label used to identify Pods
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: my-container
          image: nginx # Container image to run
```

**Command to create the Deployment:**

```bash
kubectl apply -f deployment.yaml
```

## **2. Deployment Controller Creates ReplicaSet**

- The **Deployment controller** observes the new Deployment.
- It creates a **ReplicaSet** to maintain the desired number of Pods.

## **3. ReplicaSet Creates Pods**

- The ReplicaSet notices that zero Pods are running but two are desired.
- It creates two new Pods based on the template in the Deployment.

## **4. Scheduling Pods to Nodes**

- The **Kubernetes scheduler** assigns each Pod to a suitable worker node based on resource availability.
- **Example:**
  - **Pod 1** is scheduled to **Worker Node A**.
  - **Pod 2** is scheduled to **Worker Node B**.

## **5. Pod Creation on Worker Nodes**

On each worker node, the following happens:

### **a. Kubelet Receives Pod Specification**

- The **kubelet** (agent on each node) gets the Pod specification.

### **b. Container Runtime Starts the Container**

- The kubelet uses the container runtime (like Docker or containerd) to start the container defined in the Pod.

### **c. Network Setup by CNI Plugin**

- A **Container Network Interface (CNI) plugin** (e.g., Flannel, Calico) sets up networking for the Pod.

## **6. Pod Receives an IP Address**

### **How IP Assignment Works:**

- **Pod CIDR per Node:**

  - Each worker node has a **Pod CIDR**, a range of IP addresses assigned to it.
  - **Example:**
    - **Worker Node A**: Pod CIDR `10.244.1.0/24`
    - **Worker Node B**: Pod CIDR `10.244.2.0/24`

- **CNI Plugin Assigns IP:**
  - The CNI plugin assigns an available IP address from the node's Pod CIDR to the new Pod.
  - **Example:**
    - **Pod 1** on **Worker Node A** gets IP `10.244.1.2`
    - **Pod 2** on **Worker Node B** gets IP `10.244.2.3`

### **Networking Configuration:**

- **Network Namespace:**
  - Each Pod runs in its own network namespace.
- **Virtual Ethernet Interface:**
  - A virtual network interface connects the Pod to the node's network.

## **7. Pod Becomes Ready**

- After the container starts and networking is configured, the Pod reports as **Ready**.
- The kubelet updates the cluster state to reflect the running Pod.

## **8. Communication Between Pods**

- **Cluster Networking:**
  - The network setup allows Pods on different nodes to communicate seamlessly.
- **Service Discovery:**
  - If you create a **Service**, it provides a stable IP and DNS name for accessing the Pods.

## **Summary of Key Points**

- **Deployment:**
  - Manages desired state and updates for Pods.
- **ReplicaSet:**
  - Ensures the specified number of Pod replicas are running.
- **Pods:**
  - Smallest deployable units, run containers.
- **Pod IP Assignment:**
  - Pods receive IP addresses from the node's Pod CIDR via the CNI plugin.
- **Worker Nodes:**
  - Pods are distributed across nodes based on resource availability.

## **Visual Representation**

```
[Deployment: my-deployment]
          |
      [ReplicaSet]
          |
   -----------------
   |               |
[Pod 1]         [Pod 2]
(Node A)        (Node B)
IP: 10.244.1.2  IP: 10.244.2.3
```

## **Example Workflow**

1. **Create Deployment:**
   - You apply the Deployment YAML to the cluster.
2. **Deployment Controller Actions:**
   - Creates a ReplicaSet to manage Pods.
3. **ReplicaSet Actions:**
   - Creates two Pods as specified.
4. **Scheduler Assigns Pods:**
   - Pod 1 to Node A.
   - Pod 2 to Node B.
5. **Pods Start on Nodes:**
   - Kubelet starts containers.
   - CNI plugin assigns IPs:
     - Pod 1: `10.244.1.2`
     - Pod 2: `10.244.2.3`
6. **Pods Become Ready:**
   - Pods are running and ready to accept traffic.
7. **Optional - Create Service:**
   - You can create a Service to expose the Pods under a single IP.

## **Conclusion**

- **Simple Process Flow:**
  - Deployment → ReplicaSet → Pods → Nodes → IP Assignment.
- **Pod IPs Are Unique:**
  - Each Pod gets a unique IP within the cluster.
- **Pods Across Nodes Communicate Seamlessly:**
  - Kubernetes networking ensures Pods can communicate regardless of the node they are on.

By understanding this lifecycle, you can see how Kubernetes automates the deployment and management of applications, ensuring that your Pods are correctly created, scheduled, and networked across the cluster.
