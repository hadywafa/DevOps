# CKAD Exam Notes

## Readiness probe and Liveness probe

Please understand the different between these

1. initialDelaySeconds: 15
1. periodSeconds: 20
1. failureThreshold: 3

## Root user id is `1`

## What different between taint/toleration and nodeAffinity

### **Comparison: Taint/Toleration vs. Node Affinity vs. NodeSelector**

All three control **pod placement**, but they differ in purpose and flexibility:

| **Feature**            | **Taint/Toleration**                                                                | **Node Affinity**                                                 | **NodeSelector**                               |
| ---------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| **Purpose**            | Repel pods from nodes unless tolerated                                              | Attract pods to nodes with matching labels                        | Restrict pods to nodes with specific labels    |
| **Use Case**           | Isolate workloads or prevent scheduling on certain nodes                            | Prefer or require certain nodes (e.g., GPU nodes)                 | Simple, exact node matching                    |
| **Flexibility**        | Can force or prevent scheduling using `NoSchedule`, `PreferNoSchedule`, `NoExecute` | Offers **soft** (preferred) or **hard** (required) affinity rules | Hard matching only                             |
| **Configuration**      | Set **taints** on nodes and **tolerations** on pods                                 | Use `nodeAffinity` in pod specs                                   | Use `nodeSelector` in pod specs                |
| **Expression Support** | No expressions (only key-value matching)                                            | Supports complex match expressions                                | Key-value pairs only (exact match)             |
| **When to Use**        | Avoid scheduling pods without tolerations on specific nodes                         | Schedule pods on specific nodes based on rules/labels             | Basic, direct mapping of pods to labeled nodes |

### **Examples:**

#### **Taint/Toleration:**

```bash
kubectl taint nodes <node-name> key=value:NoSchedule
```

```yaml
tolerations:
  - key: "key"
    operator: "Equal"
    value: "value"
    effect: "NoSchedule"
```

#### **Node Affinity:**

```yaml
affinity:
  nodeAffinity:
    requiredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution:
      nodeSelectorTerms:
        - matchExpressions:
            - key: "node-type"
              operator: In
              values: ["gpu"]
```

#### **NodeSelector:**

```yaml
nodeSelector:
  node-type: gpu
```

---

### **Summary:**

- **Taint/Toleration:** Prevent pods without tolerations from landing on certain nodes.
- **Node Affinity:** Offers more **flexible, rule-based scheduling** (soft or hard rules).
- **NodeSelector:** Simple, **exact match** of labels for scheduling pods.

Use **Node Affinity** for more complex logic, **Taints/Tolerations** for strict isolation, and **NodeSelector** for straightforward cases.

## Please understand the resources units such as memory and cpu

In Kubernetes, resources are measurable components like CPU and memory that containers in your Pods can request and use.

### CPU

- **CPU units**:

  - `1 CPU` = 1 core.
  - `1000m` (millicores) = 1 CPU.
  - Example: `500m` = 0.5 CPU.

- If a pod tries to exceed resources beyond its specified limit, the system will **throttle** the CPU for that pod so it can't go beyond the specified limit.

### Memory

- **Memory units**:

  - `Ki`, `Mi`, `Gi` (binary, powers of 1024):
    - `1Ki` = 1024 bytes.
    - `1Mi` = 1024 Ki.
    - `1Gi` = 1024 Mi.
  - `K`, `M`, `G` (decimal, powers of 1000):
    - `1K` = 1000 bytes.
    - `1M` = 1000 K.
    - `1G` = 1000 M.

- In case a pod tries to consume more memory than its specified limit, the pod will be **terminated** and the error will be `OOM (Out of Memory)`.

## Any strange command run it using `sh -c [COMMAND]`

```yaml
apiVersion: batch/v1
kind: Job
metadata:
  name: whalesay
spec:
  completions: 10
  backoffLimit: 6
  template:
    metadata:
      creationTimestamp: null
    spec:
      containers:
        - command:
            - sh
            - -c
            - "cowsay I am going to ace CKAD!"
          image: docker/whalesay
          name: whalesay
      restartPolicy: Never
```
