# EKS with Fargate

**Amazon EKS (Elastic Kubernetes Service) with AWS Fargate** allows you to run Kubernetes pods on serverless infrastructure. Fargate eliminates the need to manage servers and provides a way to run containers without worrying about the underlying infrastructure.

## Key Features of EKS with Fargate

1. **Serverless**: No need to provision or manage EC2 instances.
2. **Auto-scaling**: Automatically scales based on the resources your pods need.
3. **Isolation**: Each pod runs in its own environment, providing enhanced security.
4. **Cost-efficient**: Pay only for the resources you use, with pricing based on CPU and memory.

## How to Use EKS with Fargate

### 1. **Create an EKS Cluster**

- Follow the steps to create an EKS cluster using the AWS Management Console, as outlined in the previous section.

### 2. Create Fargate Role

Create an IAM role that allows EKS to manage Fargate resources on your behalf.

- **Role Name**: `eks-fargate-role`
- **Policy**: Attach the `AmazonEKSFargatePodExecutionRolePolicy` policy to the role.

### 3. **Create a Fargate Profile**

   1. **Open the EKS Console**:
      - Navigate to the [EKS console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/eks/home).

   2. **Select Cluster**:
      - Select your EKS cluster from the list.

   3. **Create Fargate Profile**:
      - Click on the **Fargate profiles** tab, then click **Add Fargate profile**.

   4. **Configure Fargate Profile**:
      - **Name**: Enter a name for your Fargate profile.
      - **Pod Execution Role**: Create or select an existing IAM role that allows EKS to create and manage Fargate resources on your behalf.
      - **Subnets**: Choose the subnets where your Fargate pods will run.
      - **Selectors**: Define selectors to determine which pods run on Fargate. For example, you can specify namespaces and labels.

   5. **Review and Create**:
      - Review the configuration and click **Create**.

### 4. **Deploy Pods to Fargate by Labeling Them to Match the Fargate Profile**

- Use `kubectl` to deploy pods that match the selectors specified in your Fargate profile. These pods will automatically run on Fargate.

#### Example deployment manifest

    ```yaml
    apiVersion: v1
    kind: Pod
    metadata:
      name: fargate-test-pod
      labels:
         app: fargate-test
      namespace: fargate-namespace
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: nginx
         image: nginx
         ports:
         - containerPort: 80
    ```

#### Apply the manifest

    ```sh
    kubectl apply -f fargate-pod.yaml
    ```

Remember to specify the namespace and labels in the deployment manifest to ensure that the pods are selected correctly for running on Fargate servers.

## Combining Fargate and Node Groups

- **Node Groups**: Managed EC2 instances that you provision and manage.
- **Fargate**: Serverless compute engine for running Kubernetes pods.

### Strategies for Combining Fargate and Node Groups

1. **Workload Segmentation**:
   - Use Fargate for smaller, stateless, or burstable workloads.
   - Use Node Groups for workloads requiring more control over the underlying infrastructure or stateful applications.

2. **Configuration**:
   - Ensure your Fargate profile selectors and Node Group configurations do not overlap.
   - Deploy workloads based on resource needs and operational requirements.

## Limits of Using EKS with Fargate

### **Persistent Storage**

- Fargate doesn't support stateful applications that require persistent storage.
- Fargate supports EFS (Elastic File System) for persistent storage, but EBS (Elastic Block Store) volumes are not supported directly.

### **Resource Limits**

- **Pod size limits**: Maximum of 4 vCPUs and 30 GB of memory per pod.
- **Fargate limits**: Some AWS services may have limits on the number of Fargate tasks that can run concurrently.

### **Networking**

- **Security groups**: Pods running on Fargate use the security groups defined in the Fargate profile.
- **Subnets**: Pods can only run in the subnets specified in the Fargate profile.

### **Service Integrations**

- Some integrations, like Amazon EFS for persistent storage, are available. However, direct access to EC2-specific features (like instance store) is not available.

## Best Practices

### **Cost Management**

- Monitor usage with AWS Cost Explorer and set up billing alerts.
- Use Fargate Spot for cost savings on interruptible workloads.

### **Security**

- Use IAM roles for service accounts to provide least privilege access to your Fargate pods.
- Regularly review and update security groups and network ACLs.

### **Monitoring and Logging**

- Use Amazon CloudWatch for monitoring and logging.
- Enable container insights for detailed performance metrics and logs.

### **Scaling**

- Configure Kubernetes Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA) and Cluster Autoscaler for efficient resource management.
