## **Full Process of Encrypting and Decrypting Data in EBS with AWS KMS** üîëüîê

This **step-by-step process** explains how the encryption and decryption work, ensuring that **EBS**, **KMS**, and **EC2** each have a clear role.

![Encrypt and Decrypt Lifecycle in KMS](images/encrypt-and-decrypt-lifecycle-in-kms.png)

### **Step 1: Create a KMS Key**

- You start by creating a **symmetric KMS key** in **AWS KMS**.
- This key will be used for encrypting and decrypting the **data key**.
- You choose this key when you create an **EC2 instance** with an **EBS volume**, so **EBS** can encrypt and decrypt the data on the volume.

---

### **Step 2: Encrypt the EBS Volume**

- When creating a new **EBS volume** or an **EC2 instance**, you choose to encrypt the **EBS volume** using the **KMS key**.
- **EBS** requests **KMS** to generate a **data key** (a symmetric key). This **data key** will be used to encrypt the data on the volume.
- **EBS** uses the **data key** to **encrypt the data** that is being written to the volume.
- The **data key** is **encrypted** using the **KMS key** and **stored alongside the encrypted data** on the volume (but it is encrypted itself).
- The **KMS key** never leaves **KMS**. Only the **encrypted data key** is stored with the encrypted data in **EBS**.

---

### **Step 3: EC2 Reads the Encrypted Data**

1. **EC2 Instance Sends Request**:

   - When the **EC2 instance** needs to **read data** from the **EBS volume**, it sends a request to **EBS**.
   - **EBS** knows that the data is encrypted and that it needs to decrypt it before returning it to **EC2**.

2. **EBS Sends the Encrypted Data Key to KMS**:

   - **EBS** retrieves the **encrypted data key** from the volume (which is stored with the encrypted data).
   - **EBS** sends the **encrypted data key** to **KMS** for decryption.

3. **KMS Decrypts the Data Key**:

   - **KMS** uses the **KMS key** (which is securely stored in **KMS**) to **decrypt** the **data key**.
   - **KMS** then returns the decrypted **data key** to **EBS**.

4. **EBS Decrypts the Data Using the Data Key**:
   - **EBS** uses the decrypted **data key** to **decrypt the data** on the volume.
   - The decrypted data is then sent back to the **EC2 instance**.

---

### **Step 4: EC2 Writes Data to the Encrypted EBS Volume**

1. **EC2 Writes Data to EBS**:

   - The **EC2 instance** creates new data (e.g., saving a file or writing application data).
   - **EC2** sends this **unencrypted data** to **EBS**.

2. **EBS Encrypts the Data**:

   - **EBS** **encrypts the new data** using the **data key** (the same key that was used for encrypting data earlier).
   - **EBS** now has the **data key** (which was previously decrypted by **KMS**).

3. **EBS Re-encrypts the Data Key**:
   - After encrypting the new data, **EBS** **re-encrypts** the **data key** using the **KMS key**.
   - This **re-encrypted data key** is stored alongside the newly encrypted data on the **EBS volume**.

---

### **Step 5: Temporary Storage of the Data Key in EBS**

- **EBS** stores the **decrypted data key** in **its memory** temporarily for **encryption** and **decryption** purposes.
- If **EBS** loses this key (e.g., due to a restart), it will need to **request the decrypted data key from KMS** again.

---

### **Step 6: Access Control and Key Management**

- **IAM (Identity and Access Management)**: The access to the **KMS key** is controlled through **IAM roles and policies**.
- Only authorized users or services (with the right IAM permissions) can request and use the **KMS key** to encrypt or decrypt data.

- **KMS Key Rotation**: You can rotate the **KMS key** periodically. If you rotate the **KMS key**, **EBS** will need to start using the new key for encryption and decryption processes.

---

### **Summary of the Entire Encryption and Decryption Process**

1. **Create a KMS key** for encryption and decryption.
2. **Encrypt the EBS volume** using the **KMS key**:
   - **EBS** generates a **data key** (symmetric) and uses it to encrypt the data.
   - The **data key** is stored **encrypted** on the volume.
3. When the **EC2 instance reads** the data:
   - **EBS** sends the **encrypted data key** to **KMS**.
   - **KMS** decrypts it and returns the decrypted **data key** to **EBS**.
   - **EBS** uses the **decrypted data key** to decrypt the data and sends it to **EC2**.
4. When the **EC2 instance writes** data:
   - **EBS** uses the **data key** to encrypt the data and stores the encrypted data alongside the **re-encrypted data key**.
5. **EBS stores** the **decrypted data key** temporarily in **its memory**.
   - If **EBS** restarts, it will **request the decrypted data key from KMS** again.

---

### **Key Points:**

- **Encryption and decryption** are **handled by EBS**, but **KMS** is responsible for managing and decrypting the **data key**.
- The **data key** is stored **encrypted** on the **EBS volume**.
- **EBS** stores the **decrypted data key temporarily** in its memory to handle encryption and decryption.
- **KMS** is only contacted when **EBS needs to decrypt the data key** (e.g., when the key is lost or after a restart).
