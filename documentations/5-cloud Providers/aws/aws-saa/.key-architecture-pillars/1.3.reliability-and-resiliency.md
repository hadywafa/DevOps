# **Reliability and Resiliency** 🔧

When designing cloud-based applications, understanding **reliability** and **resiliency** is crucial. Here’s a simplified explanation:

## **Reliability** 🛠️

**Reliability** means that a system works consistently and without failure over time. It involves:

- **Automatic Recovery**: The system can fix itself when something breaks.
- **Scalability**: The system can add more resources (like servers) to handle increased demand.

### **Key Points**:

1. **Automatic Recovery**: If a server crashes, the system restores itself.
2. **Scalability**: Adding more servers to keep up with growing users or data.

## **Resiliency** 💪

**Resiliency** is the system's ability to recover from issues quickly. It ensures:

- **Recovery from Failures**: The system can repair itself after a disruption.
- **Dynamic Scaling**: The system can automatically get more resources when needed.
- **Mitigating Disruptions**: It handles temporary problems without significant impact.

### **Key Points**:

1. **Recovery from Failures**: If something goes wrong, it can quickly fix or work around the issue.
2. **Dynamic Scaling**: Automatically scaling resources up or down based on demand.
3. **Mitigating Issues**: Dealing with temporary problems like misconfigurations smoothly.

## **Relationship between Reliability and Resiliency** 🔄

- A system’s **reliability** depends on its **resiliency**. If a system can quickly recover and scale, it becomes more reliable.

**Example**: An online shopping site

- **Resilient Design**: If a server fails, another server takes over.
- **Reliable Service**: The site stays running smoothly even if there are issues behind the scenes.

## **In Summary** 📚

- **Reliability**: System stays up and running with minimal problems.
- **Resiliency**: System can handle problems and recover quickly.
