# **EC2 Fundamental**

## **What is an EC2 Instance?** 🖥️

An **EC2 instance** is a **virtual server** in the AWS cloud. It provides **scalable compute capacity** that allows you to run applications without having to invest in physical hardware. Each EC2 instance operates like a **standalone machine** but is hosted within AWS's infrastructure.

EC2 instances provide flexibility in terms of:

- **Operating systems**: Choose between **Linux**, **Windows**, or custom images.
- **Instance types**: You can choose from various types based on your CPU, memory, and storage needs (e.g., **t2.micro**, **m5.large**, **c5.xlarge**).

## **Key Components of an EC2 Instance** 🔧

An EC2 instance is made up of several components that define its **performance** and **resource allocation**:

1. **vCPUs (Virtual CPUs)**: Virtualized CPUs assigned to each EC2 instance. Each **vCPU** corresponds to a thread on the host’s physical CPU cores.
2. **Memory (RAM)**: The amount of **RAM** allocated to the instance, used for running applications and processes.
3. **Storage**: This refers to the disk space available to the EC2 instance. AWS provides two types of storage for EC2:
   - **Instance Store** (temporary storage attached to the instance).
     - Access to data is So fast (used for distributed system application like scale stateful apps / high input-output databases).
     - ec2 instance with instance store root volumes are called **instance-stored backed ec2 instant**
   - **EBS (Elastic Block Store)** (persistent storage for data and system files).
     - Persistence (used persistence purpose such as setup os system files).
     - ec2 instance with ebs root volumes are called **ebs backed ec2 instant**
4. **Networking**: The network interfaces and **IP addresses** assigned to the instance for communication.

## **Relationship Between EC2 and EBS** 💾

**Amazon EBS** is a **scalable** and **persistent block storage** service that provides **durable** storage for EC2 instances. It is designed to store **operating system files**, application data, and other files that need to persist beyond the life of the instance.

### **Why Do We Need EBS?** 🤔

You may wonder why EC2 instances don’t store their **operating system files** directly on the hypervisor's **virtual storage**. Here’s why **EBS** is crucial:

1. **Persistence**: While **instance store** provides temporary storage tied to the lifecycle of the EC2 instance, **EBS volumes** are **persistent**. They remain intact even if the EC2 instance is stopped or terminated. This makes **EBS** ideal for **critical data** that must survive instance reboots or failures.

2. **Separation of Compute and Storage**: Using **EBS** for storage allows EC2 instances to focus on **computation** while **EBS** handles data storage independently. This separation provides **flexibility** and enables you to **scale** compute and storage independently.

3. **Scalability**: **EBS volumes** can be **dynamically resized** based on your needs, ensuring your application gets the storage it needs without interrupting your workload.

## **How AWS Connects EC2 and EBS in the Background** 🔗

In AWS, **EC2 instances** and **EBS volumes** are connected in the background through the **AWS Elastic Block Store (EBS)** service. When you launch an EC2 instance, it is **linked to an EBS volume** to provide persistent storage. Here’s how it works:

1. **Creation of EBS Volume**:

   - When an EC2 instance is launched, you can specify an **EBS volume** as the root device or additional volumes for storage.
   - AWS uses **EBS APIs** to create and allocate storage resources, and these volumes are automatically associated with the instance.

2. **Attachment Process**:

   - Once the instance is launched, AWS attaches the **EBS volume** to the instance over the **network** (using the **Elastic Block Store protocol**).
   - The volume is then **mounted** as a **block device** within the instance's operating system, allowing it to be used for file storage, databases, or application data.

3. **Data Flow**:

   - All **read and write** operations to the volume happen over the **AWS network** using the **EBS protocol**. The data is stored on **physical disk** located within an AWS data center.
   - EBS provides **durability** by replicating data across multiple servers within the **availability zone**, ensuring **data persistence** even if the EC2 instance is stopped or terminated.

4. **Scaling**:
   - As EC2 instances scale, the **EBS volume** can also scale (in size and performance), ensuring that the attached storage meets the growing demands of the application.

## **Scaling EC2 and EBS Resources** 📈

One of the main advantages of AWS is the **ability to scale** both **EC2 instances** and **EBS volumes** independently to meet your application's demands.

### **Scaling EC2 Resources:**

- **Vertical Scaling** (Scaling Up/Down): You can **resize your EC2 instance** to a larger or smaller instance type to meet changing compute requirements (e.g., scaling from **t2.micro** to **m5.large**).
- **Horizontal Scaling** (Scaling Out/In): Add more EC2 instances using **Auto Scaling** to handle larger workloads or to ensure high availability.

### **Scaling EBS Resources:**

- **Resizing Volumes**: You can **increase** the size of an EBS volume without stopping the EC2 instance.
- **Performance Scaling**: You can **scale IOPS** and throughput of your EBS volumes based on the performance needs of your application (e.g., upgrading from **gp3** to **io2**).
- **Snapshots**: EBS allows you to take **snapshots** of volumes, providing a way to **scale** and **backup** data as your application grows.

## **Conclusion** 🚀

- **EBS** plays a crucial role in providing **persistent storage** for EC2 instances, ensuring that system files and data remain available even if the instance is stopped or terminated.
- By decoupling **compute and storage** and offering scalable, flexible storage options, **EBS** ensures that you can easily **scale** both your EC2 instances and storage independently.
- Whether you need **high-performance SSDs** or **lower-cost HDDs**, EBS offers a variety of volume types tailored to your specific needs.

With **EBS** and **EC2**, you can scale your infrastructure to meet the demands of your applications, whether you're running small websites or enterprise-level applications, all while maintaining **cost efficiency** and **data reliability**.
