# **EC2 Monitoring üñ•Ô∏è**

Monitoring your EC2 instances is crucial to ensuring they are running efficiently and without issues. AWS provides built-in monitoring features like **CloudWatch** to help track performance and detect problems in your EC2 instances.

## **EC2 Status Checks** ‚úÖ

AWS performs **status checks** every minute to ensure your instance is healthy:

- **System Status Check**: Monitors hardware or network issues that need AWS intervention (e.g., network connectivity, hardware failures).
- **Instance Status Check**: Detects issues that require your intervention (e.g., misconfigured startup, full disk space, or exhausted memory).

### **Status Check Failures**

- When a status check fails, CloudWatch metrics are triggered.
- You can set **CloudWatch alarms** to notify you (via **SNS**) or take action when these failures occur.

## **Monitoring with CloudWatch üìä**

- **Basic Monitoring**: Automatically sends metrics (every 5 minutes) for free.
- **Detailed Monitoring**: Sends metrics every minute for a charge (~\$2.1/month).

### **Key Metrics**

- **Default Metrics**: CPU, Network, Disk Utilization.
- **Custom Metrics**: Memory, Disk Space, and Swap utilization (requires CloudWatch Agent).

| **Default Metrics** (Sent by default to CW) | **Custom Metrics** (Requires CloudWatch Agent) |
| ------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| **CPU Utilization**                         | **Memory Utilization**                         |
| **Network Utilization**                     | **Disk Swap Utilization**                      |
| **Disk Performance**                        | **Disk Space Utilization**                     |
| **Disk Read/Write Operations**              | **Page File Utilization**                      |
|                                             | **Log Collection**                             |

## **CloudWatch Alarms and Events üîî**

- **Alarms**: You can set alarms to trigger actions, such as automatically stopping, rebooting, or recovering EC2 instances when a status check fails.

  - **Recover** action applies to **System Status Check** failures.
  - **Reboot** action applies to **Instance Status Check** failures.

- **CloudWatch Events**: Respond to events like application issues or resource changes automatically.

## **Conclusion üèÅ**

EC2 monitoring is essential for maintaining the health and performance of your instances. By leveraging **CloudWatch** for tracking, creating alarms, and responding to events, you can ensure that any issues are detected and handled efficiently, helping to minimize downtime and improve reliability.
