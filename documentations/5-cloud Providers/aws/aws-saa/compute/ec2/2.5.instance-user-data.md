# **Instance User Data** üìù

**Instance User Data** is data provided by the user during EC2 instance launch in the form of a script that is executed when the instance boots. This can be used to automate instance configuration, install software, or run initialization scripts. However, there are a few important considerations and steps to follow:

## **Key Points about Instance User Data** üõ†Ô∏è

- **Size Limit**: The data is limited to **16 KB** in size.
- **Modifiable**: User data can be changed, but the instance must be **stopped** first (for EBS-backed EC2 instances).
- **Not Encrypted**: User data is **not encrypted** by default. Avoid storing sensitive data such as passwords or encryption keys in the user data.
- **Cost**: There are **no charges** for accessing user data.
- **Available at Boot**: User data scripts are executed when the instance boots, providing a way to configure the instance automatically.

## **Accessing Instance User Data** üí°

To retrieve the user data of an EC2 instance, you can use the following `curl` command:

```bash
curl http://169.254.169.254/latest/user-data/
```

However, if you are using **IMDSv2 (Instance Metadata Service Version 2)**, you will need to follow a specific set of steps due to session-based authentication.

### **Steps for Accessing User Data with IMDSv2** üîë

If your instance has **IMDSv2 enabled** (which is the default for new instances), follow these steps to access the instance metadata, including user data:

1. **Request a Session Token**:

   Since IMDSv2 requires a session token for accessing metadata, you first need to request it. Use the following command:

   ```bash
   TOKEN=$(curl -X PUT "http://169.254.169.254/latest/api/token" -H "X-aws-ec2-metadata-token-ttl-seconds: 21600")
   ```

   This will return a session token.

2. **Access User Data**:

   Once you have the session token, you can use it to fetch the instance's user data. Here‚Äôs the command to do so:

   ```bash
   curl -H "X-aws-ec2-metadata-token: $TOKEN" http://169.254.169.254/latest/user-data/
   ```

   This will display the **user data** that was supplied when the instance was launched.

### **Important Considerations** ‚ö†Ô∏è

- **IMDSv2**: If IMDSv2 is enabled, you must request the token before accessing the metadata. **IMDSv2** is more secure as it prevents unauthorized access to instance metadata, which can help mitigate potential security risks.

- **Security**: Always avoid storing sensitive information in user data since it's accessible to anyone with access to the instance. Consider using a more secure method, such as AWS Secrets Manager, for storing secrets or passwords.
