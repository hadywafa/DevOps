# **Hypervisors** üñ•Ô∏è

## **What is a Hypervisor?** ü§î

A **hypervisor** is **software** that allows multiple **virtual machines (VMs)** to run simultaneously on a **single physical machine**. The hypervisor does this by abstracting the hardware resources (such as CPU, memory, and storage) and allocating them to each VM. Hypervisors are essential for **virtualization**, enabling the efficient use of physical resources.

In the context of **AWS**, the **hypervisor** plays a central role in running virtual instances (like EC2 instances), ensuring that each instance gets its share of CPU, memory, and storage from the physical hardware.

## **Types of Hypervisors** üîß

There are two primary types of hypervisors, and AWS uses a combination of these depending on the instance and the underlying hardware.

1. **Type 1 Hypervisor (Bare Metal)** üèóÔ∏è

   - **Runs directly on the physical hardware** without an underlying operating system.
   - Examples: **Xen**, **AWS Nitro**.

2. **Type 2 Hypervisor (Hosted)** üñ±Ô∏è
   - **Runs on top of an existing operating system**, using the host OS to manage hardware resources.
   - Examples: VMware **Workstation**, **VirtualBox** (not used in AWS).

In AWS, **Type 1 hypervisors** are used for their production environments, including **Xen** and **Nitro**.

## **AWS Hypervisors: Xen vs Nitro** ‚öîÔ∏è

**1. Xen Hypervisor in AWS:** üíª

- **Xen** is the original hypervisor used by AWS to run EC2 instances, especially in older instance types.
- **Key Features**:

  - **Open-source** hypervisor used in many virtualization platforms.
  - Allows for the creation and management of VMs on physical hardware.
  - **Security**: Each instance is isolated through **Xen's domain-based architecture**, where each VM (known as a "domain") is given its own **virtual CPU** and **memory**.

- **Resource Management**:

  - Xen uses the **CPU** and **memory** of the host machine to run multiple EC2 instances.
  - Instances run in **isolated virtual machines** and share resources efficiently.

- **Performance**:
  - While effective, Xen has some overhead compared to newer hypervisors like **AWS Nitro** due to its more complex resource management and virtualization layer.

**2. AWS Nitro Hypervisor:** üöÄ

- The **AWS Nitro System** is a **newer** and **more efficient** hypervisor that AWS developed to overcome the limitations of Xen and improve **performance**, **security**, and **scalability**.
- **Key Features**:

  - A **lightweight hypervisor** that uses a combination of **dedicated hardware** (called **Nitro Cards**) and software for virtualization.
  - **Security**: The Nitro system provides enhanced security through **hardware root of trust** and **instance isolation**.
  - **Performance**: Nitro offloads tasks like **networking** and **storage** to specialized hardware, reducing overhead and improving performance compared to Xen.

- **Resource Management**:

  - **CPU and memory** are allocated to EC2 instances, but the **Nitro hypervisor** itself has **minimal overhead** because much of the resource management is handled by **dedicated hardware**.
  - **Storage**: Nitro integrates with **Elastic Block Store (EBS)** for persistent storage, while networking is optimized for high-performance **Elastic Network Adapter (ENA)**.

- **Performance**:
  - The **Nitro system** provides **better performance**, **lower latency**, and **improved scalability** compared to Xen because it doesn't need to rely on a traditional, resource-heavy hypervisor.

## **Why AWS Uses Both Xen and Nitro** üîÑ

- AWS uses **Xen** for older EC2 instances and **Nitro** for newer, high-performance instances.
- **Xen** is still in use for **legacy support**, while **Nitro** offers better **performance**, **security**, and **scalability** for **modern workloads**.

---

## **Conclusion** üåü

- **Xen** and **AWS Nitro** are the main hypervisors used in **AWS EC2 instances**.
- **Xen** has been the backbone of AWS's virtualization, but **Nitro** is a newer, more efficient, and secure system that reduces overhead, improves performance, and enhances scalability.
- The **physical hardware** (servers) running these hypervisors must be powerful enough to handle **multiple VMs** with large resource allocations (CPU, RAM, and storage).

AWS's adoption of the **Nitro system** shows its commitment to improving **performance**, **security**, and **efficiency** in its cloud infrastructure. The **lightweight design** of Nitro ensures that the **hypervisor** uses minimal resources, allowing EC2 instances to run faster and with **better isolation**.

This **virtualization** system is the foundation for all **AWS cloud services** like EC2, enabling **scalable**, **cost-effective**, and **secure** cloud environments.
