# **Hypervisors** üñ•Ô∏è

## **What is a Hypervisor?** ü§î

A **hypervisor** is **software** that allows multiple **virtual machines (VMs)** to run simultaneously on a **single physical machine**. The hypervisor does this by abstracting the hardware resources (such as CPU, memory, and storage) and allocating them to each VM. Hypervisors are essential for **virtualization**, enabling the efficient use of physical resources.

In the context of **AWS**, the **hypervisor** plays a central role in running virtual instances (like EC2 instances), ensuring that each instance gets its share of CPU, memory, and storage from the physical hardware.

## **Types of Hypervisors** üîß

There are two primary types of hypervisors, and AWS uses a combination of these depending on the instance and the underlying hardware.

1. **Type 1 Hypervisor (Bare Metal)** üèóÔ∏è

   - **Runs directly on the physical hardware** without an underlying operating system.
   - Examples: **Xen**, **AWS Nitro**.

2. **Type 2 Hypervisor (Hosted)** üñ±Ô∏è
   - **Runs on top of an existing operating system**, using the host OS to manage hardware resources.
   - Examples: VMware **Workstation**, **VirtualBox** (not used in AWS).

In AWS, **Type 1 hypervisors** are used for their production environments, including **Xen** and **Nitro**.

## **AWS Hypervisors: Xen vs Nitro** ‚öîÔ∏è

Amazon Web Services (AWS) uses two primary hypervisors to manage EC2 instances: **Xen** and **Nitro**. The transition from Xen to Nitro represents a significant leap forward in terms of **performance**, **security**, and **scalability**. Here‚Äôs a deep dive into the differences between the two and how they impact your EC2 workloads.

### **1. Xen Hypervisor in AWS:** üíª

- **Xen** was the original hypervisor used by AWS for managing EC2 instances. It powered many of the earlier EC2 instance types and is still used for some legacy workloads.

#### **Key Features**:

- **Open-source**: Xen is an open-source hypervisor widely adopted in the industry. It‚Äôs used not only by AWS but also in many other cloud providers and virtualization platforms.
- **Domain-based architecture**: Xen uses a **domain-based architecture**, where each EC2 instance (or "domain") operates in a virtualized environment with its own virtual CPU, memory, and network interfaces.
- **Security**: Provides strong isolation between virtual machines (VMs) using its domain architecture, ensuring that each instance is isolated from the others.
- **Resource Management**: Xen uses the **host machine's resources** (CPU, memory) to manage multiple EC2 instances. It operates as a **Type-1 hypervisor**, running directly on the hardware (bare metal), with other software instances running on top.

#### **Performance Considerations**:

- While effective, Xen introduces some **overhead** due to the **virtualization layer** and its resource management model. This overhead can impact performance in workloads requiring high IOPS (Input/Output Operations Per Second), low latency, or fast network throughput.
- **Legacy EC2 Instance Types**: Older instance types like **m3** and **c3** use Xen as the underlying hypervisor.

### **2. AWS Nitro Hypervisor:** üöÄ

AWS introduced the **Nitro System** as the next-generation hypervisor designed to address the limitations of Xen. It offers **better performance**, **enhanced security**, and **improved scalability**.

#### **Key Features**:

- **Lightweight Hypervisor**: The Nitro hypervisor is much lighter than Xen, with most of the resource management being offloaded to dedicated **hardware** components known as **Nitro Cards**. This results in minimal overhead.
- **Dedicated Hardware**: The Nitro system offloads functions like networking, storage, and security to **dedicated hardware**, enabling the hypervisor to focus solely on CPU and memory management.
- **Security**: Nitro enhances security with **hardware root of trust**, which ensures that only trusted code runs on the system. This is especially important in high-security environments where data isolation and integrity are paramount.
- **Performance**: By offloading networking and storage functions to specialized hardware, the Nitro system provides **lower latency**, **higher throughput**, and **better overall performance** compared to Xen.

#### **Resource Management**:

- **CPU and Memory**: The Nitro hypervisor allocates CPU and memory resources to EC2 instances, but much of the resource management is handled by dedicated **Nitro Cards**, reducing the load on the hypervisor itself.
- **Storage**: The Nitro system integrates tightly with **Elastic Block Store (EBS)** for persistent storage, providing **faster disk I/O**.
- **Networking**: Nitro uses **Elastic Network Adapter (ENA)**, a high-performance network interface that supports **low-latency** and **high-throughput networking**.

#### **Performance Considerations**:

- **Higher Performance**: Nitro-based instances, such as **C5**, **M5**, and **R5** series, deliver better performance with significantly reduced latency and faster networking speeds compared to Xen.
- **Lower Overhead**: With fewer resources devoted to the hypervisor itself, Nitro instances can provide closer to **bare-metal performance** for EC2 workloads.

## **Conclusion** üåü

- **Xen** and **AWS Nitro** are the main hypervisors used in **AWS EC2 instances**.
- **Xen** has been the backbone of AWS's virtualization, but **Nitro** is a newer, more efficient, and secure system that reduces overhead, improves performance, and enhances scalability.
- The **physical hardware** (servers) running these hypervisors must be powerful enough to handle **multiple VMs** with large resource allocations (CPU, RAM, and storage).

AWS's adoption of the **Nitro system** shows its commitment to improving **performance**, **security**, and **efficiency** in its cloud infrastructure. The **lightweight design** of Nitro ensures that the **hypervisor** uses minimal resources, allowing EC2 instances to run faster and with **better isolation**.

This **virtualization** system is the foundation for all **AWS cloud services** like EC2, enabling **scalable**, **cost-effective**, and **secure** cloud environments.
