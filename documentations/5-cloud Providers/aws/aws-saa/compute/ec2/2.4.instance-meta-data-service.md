# **AWS Instance Metadata Service (IMDS) üßæ**

**Instance metadata** is information about your EC2 instance that can be used to configure or manage the instance. It includes essential details like:

- **Instance ID**
- **IPv4 and IPv6 address**
- **AMI ID**
- **Instance type**
- **Security groups**
- **Public and private IP addresses**
- **Key pairs and other metadata**

This data is available to your applications and instances for easy access and management. It can be used for automated instance management, monitoring, and more.

## **Instance Metadata Service (IMDS) Versions** üîë

AWS provides two versions of **Instance Metadata Service**:

### **IMDSv1 (Version 1):**

- Request-response based system.
- No session authentication.

### **IMDSv2 (Version 2):**

- **Session-oriented**, requiring a session token for access.
- Enhances security by requiring an authentication token before any request.
- Protects against SSRF (Server Side Request Forgery) attacks.

By default, AWS uses **IMDSv2** for enhanced security, although you can choose to use **IMDSv1** if necessary.

## **How to Access Metadata** üåç

### **Accessing Metadata with IMDSv1**

If you're using **IMDSv1**, you can access metadata directly by sending HTTP requests to the following endpoint:

```bash
curl http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/
```

This provides metadata information without requiring authentication tokens.

### **Accessing Metadata with IMDSv2**

With **IMDSv2**, you first need to request a session token to access the metadata.

1. **Step 1: Generate the token**:

   Use the following `curl` command to generate a token:

   ```bash
   TOKEN=$(curl -X PUT "http://169.254.169.254/latest/api/token" -H "X-aws-ec2-metadata-token-ttl-seconds: 21600")
   ```

   - This sends a `PUT` request to generate a token valid for **21600 seconds (6 hours)**.

2. **Step 2: Use the token to access metadata**:

   Once you have the token, you use it in your request to fetch metadata:

   ```bash
   curl -H "X-aws-ec2-metadata-token: $TOKEN" http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/
   ```

   - The `-H` header is used to pass the session token for authentication.

## **Enabling IMDSv2 if You Are on IMDSv1** üõ†Ô∏è

If your EC2 instance is currently using **IMDSv1**, you can enable **IMDSv2** by modifying the instance‚Äôs metadata settings.

### **Steps to Enable IMDSv2:**

1. **Via the EC2 Console**:

   - Go to the **EC2 Management Console**.
   - Select the EC2 instance that you want to modify.
   - Under the **Actions** menu, go to **Instance Settings** > **Modify Instance Metadata Options**.
   - In the **Instance Metadata Service** section, select **IMDSv2** and **Disable IMDSv1**.
   - Save the changes.

2. **Via AWS CLI**:
   You can use the following AWS CLI command to enable IMDSv2 and disable IMDSv1:

   ```bash
   aws ec2 modify-instance-metadata-options --instance-id i-xxxxxxxx --metadata-options "HttpTokens=required,HttpEndpoint=enabled"
   ```

   - This command forces the instance to require **IMDSv2** and disables **IMDSv1**.

3. **Reboot the Instance**:
   After making the changes, you may need to reboot the instance for the changes to take effect.

## **Security Considerations** üîê

- **IMDSv2 provides better security**: It requires a session token to access metadata, reducing the risk of SSRF attacks.
- **Avoid storing sensitive data in metadata**: Since metadata is not encrypted, do not store secrets, passwords, or long-term credentials in instance metadata.
- **You can disable IMDSv1**: AWS allows you to configure your instance so that only **IMDSv2** is accessible, further securing your metadata.

## **Disabling IMDS** üö´

For security reasons, you can choose to **disable IMDS** on your EC2 instance if your application doesn't need access to instance metadata:

1. **Disable IMDSv1**:

   - You can disable **IMDSv1** and force the instance to only use **IMDSv2** through the EC2 instance settings.

2. **Disabling access to metadata entirely**:
   - If the metadata is unnecessary, you can choose to **disable access to instance metadata** completely.

## **Summary** üìù

- **Instance metadata** provides important information about your EC2 instance and can be accessed via **IMDS**.
- **IMDSv2** is more secure than **IMDSv1**, offering **session-based access**.
- Use **tokens** for accessing **IMDSv2**, and you can disable or configure access based on your instance‚Äôs security needs.
- Always **avoid storing sensitive data** in metadata and configure it securely for your instances.
