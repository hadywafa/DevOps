# EC2 Purchasing/Launch Options üí°

Amazon EC2 provides a variety of purchasing and launch options that cater to different workloads, usage patterns, and cost preferences. Understanding these options helps optimize costs and choose the best fit for your specific needs. Here‚Äôs a breakdown of the various **EC2 purchasing and launch options**:

## **1. On-Demand Instances üí∏** (Most Expensive)

### **Key Features**

- **Pay-as-you-go**: You pay for compute capacity by the second (for Linux) or by the hour (for other operating systems).
- **No long-term commitment**: You can launch, stop, and terminate instances at any time, with no upfront costs.

### **Payment Options**

- **Hourly/Per Second Billing**: You are billed based on the duration the instance is running, whether by the second (for Linux) or hourly (for other operating systems).

### **Use Case**

- Ideal for **short-term, unpredictable workloads** or environments with fluctuating demands like **testing**, **development**, or **one-time projects**.

## **2. On-Demand Instances - Capacity Reservation üìÖ** (No Commitment, No Discount)

### **Key Features**

- **Capacity Reservation**: Reserve a specific instance type in a particular **Availability Zone (AZ)**.
- **Charged** whether the capacity is being used or not, providing you with guaranteed capacity.

### **Payment Options**

- **Hourly Billing**: You pay for the reserved capacity regardless of whether the instance is running or not.

### **Use Case**

- Suitable for **predictable high-load periods** such as **holiday sales**, **end-of-quarter processing**, or critical applications where you need guaranteed resources. You can plan for high demand and ensure you always have the necessary capacity.

## **3. Reserved Instances (RIs) ü§ù**

Reserved Instances offer substantial savings for committing to specific EC2 instance types for a set period (1- or 3-year commitment).

### **Types of Reserved Instances**:

#### **(a) Standard RIs (Highest Discounts) üí∞**

- **Key Features**:

  - **Up to 75% discount** compared to On-Demand pricing.
  - Commitment to a specific instance type, but you can modify the instance size (type/family cannot be changed).
  - **Can be sold in the AWS Marketplace** if you no longer need the instance reservation.

- **Payment Options**:

  - **All Upfront**: Pay the full amount for the reserved term (1 or 3 years).
  - **Partial Upfront**: Pay part upfront, and the rest monthly.
  - **No Upfront**: Pay monthly over the term of the reservation.

- **Use Case**:

  - Ideal for **long-term workloads** with predictable usage, such as **web hosting** or **enterprise applications**, where you need guaranteed capacity for an extended period.

- **Modification Notes**:
  - If you change to a larger instance size, you **pay the difference** in cost.
  - If you change to a smaller instance size, **you won‚Äôt get a refund** for the difference, but you will still pay the original cost of the Reserved Instance.

#### **(b) Convertible RIs (Lower Discount) üîÑ**

- **Key Features**:

  - **Up to 54% discount** compared to On-Demand pricing.
  - Flexible to modify the instance **type**, **family**, **OS**, and **tenancy**.
  - You can exchange or modify your Convertible RI based on your changing needs.

- **Payment Options**:

  - **All Upfront**: Pay the full amount for the reserved term (1 or 3 years).
  - **Partial Upfront**: Pay part upfront, and the rest monthly.
  - **No Upfront**: Pay monthly over the term of the reservation.

- **Use Case**:

  - Ideal for workloads with **changing requirements** or **future scaling needs**, such as applications where future instance type adjustments are anticipated.

- **Modification Notes**:
  - Convertible RIs allow more flexibility than Standard RIs. You can modify the instance **type**, **family**, **operating system**, and **tenancy**.
  - If you change to a more expensive instance, you **pay the difference** in price. However, if you change to a cheaper instance, AWS **won‚Äôt refund the difference** but will still charge based on the original cost.

## **4. Savings Plans ü§ë**

Savings Plans offer a flexible pricing model that provides **up to 72% savings** in exchange for committing to a certain amount of usage (in **\$ per hour**) for 1 or 3 years.

### **Types of Savings Plans**:

#### **(a) Compute Savings Plans üñ•Ô∏è**

- **Key Features**:

  - **Up to 66% savings**.
  - Savings apply to any EC2 instance usage, regardless of **region**, **instance family**, **OS**, or **tenancy**.
  - Also applies to AWS **Fargate** and **Lambda** compute usage.

- **Payment Options**:

  - **All Upfront**: Pay the full commitment upfront.
  - **Partial Upfront**: Pay part upfront, and the rest monthly.
  - **No Upfront**: Pay monthly over the term.

- **Use Case**:
  - Ideal for organizations with **variable workloads** that need flexibility but want to commit to a certain level of compute usage, such as **hybrid cloud scenarios** or **mixed-use environments**.

#### **(b) EC2 Instance Savings Plans üè∑Ô∏è**

- **Key Features**:

  - **Up to 72% savings**.
  - Savings apply to EC2 instances **within a specific instance family** in a given region.
  - Offers flexibility within the instance family, such as using any **size**, **OS**, or **tenancy**.

- **Payment Options**:

  - **All Upfront**: Pay the full commitment upfront.
  - **Partial Upfront**: Pay part upfront, and the rest monthly.
  - **No Upfront**: Pay monthly over the term.

- **Use Case**:
  - Best for organizations that use a **specific instance family** in a particular region and want to save on costs for long-term workloads.

## **5. Spot Instances üí•**

Spot Instances let you use unused EC2 capacity at a **massive discount (up to 90%)** compared to On-Demand pricing.

### **Key Features**

- **Interruptible**: Spot instances can be terminated by AWS if the spot price exceeds your bid or if capacity is no longer available.
- **Availability is not guaranteed**: Instances may be terminated at any time.

### **Payment Options**

- **Pay-per-use**: You pay the price for the instance based on the current **Spot price**.

### **Use Case**

- Ideal for **non-critical workloads** that can tolerate interruptions, such as **batch processing**, **data analysis**, or **scientific simulations**.

## **6. Dedicated Instances and Hosts üè¢**

### **(a) Dedicated Instances üè†**

- **Key Features**:

  - Run on **single-tenant hardware**.

### **3. No Upfront** üí≥

- Pay monthly based on your commitment, with no upfront costs.

- **Example**: You commit to **\$100/hour** for a year, but instead of paying upfront, you pay monthly based on the total commitment.

## **Conclusion üèÅ**

Choosing the right EC2 purchasing option depends on your workload‚Äôs needs and cost management strategy. **On-demand** instances provide the greatest flexibility but at a higher cost, while **Reserved Instances** and **Savings Plans** offer significant savings for long-term, predictable workloads. **Spot Instances** offer massive discounts but come with availability risks, and **Dedicated Instances/Hosts** are ideal for compliance-heavy or specialized use cases. By understanding the differences between these options, you can make an informed decision to optimize your AWS costs and resources.
