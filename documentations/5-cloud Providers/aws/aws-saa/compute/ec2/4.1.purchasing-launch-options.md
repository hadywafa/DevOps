# EC2 Purchasing/Launch Options üí°

Amazon EC2 provides a variety of purchasing and launch options that cater to different workloads, usage patterns, and cost preferences. Understanding these options helps optimize costs and choose the best fit for your specific needs. Here‚Äôs a breakdown of the various **EC2 purchasing and launch options**:

## **1. On-Demand Instances üí∏** (Most Expensive)

### **Key Features**

- **Pay-as-you-go**: You pay for compute capacity by the second (for Linux) or by the hour (for other operating systems).
- **No long-term commitment**: You can launch, stop, and terminate instances at any time, with no upfront costs.

### **Payment Options**

- **Hourly/Per Second Billing**: You are billed based on the duration the instance is running, whether by the second (for Linux) or hourly (for other operating systems).

### **Performance Considerations**

- On-Demand Instances are perfect for workloads that need **instant scalability** without commitment. However, they can be more expensive in the long term compared to Reserved Instances or Savings Plans.

### **Use Case**

- Ideal for **short-term, unpredictable workloads** or environments with fluctuating demands like **testing**, **development**, or **one-time projects**.

## **2. On-Demand Instances - Capacity Reservation üìÖ** (No Commitment, No Discount)

### **Key Features**

- **Capacity Reservation**: Reserve a specific instance type in a particular **Availability Zone (AZ)**.
- **Charged** whether the capacity is being used or not, providing you with guaranteed capacity.

### **Payment Options**

- **Hourly Billing**: You pay for the reserved capacity regardless of whether the instance is running or not.

### **Performance Considerations**

- Capacity Reservations offer guaranteed capacity, making them suitable for high-traffic or mission-critical applications.

### **Use Case**

- Suitable for **predictable high-load periods** such as **holiday sales**, **end-of-quarter processing**, or critical applications where you need guaranteed resources. You can plan for high demand and ensure you always have the necessary capacity.

## **3. Reserved Instances (RIs) ü§ù**

Reserved Instances offer substantial savings for committing to specific EC2 instance types for a set period (1- or 3-year commitment).

### **Types of Reserved Instances**:

#### **(a) Standard RIs (Highest Discounts) üí∞**

- **Key Features**:

  - **Up to 75% discount** compared to On-Demand pricing.
  - Commitment to a specific instance type, but you can modify the instance size (type/family cannot be changed).
  - **Can be sold in the AWS Marketplace** if you no longer need the instance reservation.

- **Payment Options**:

  - **All Upfront**: Pay the full amount for the reserved term (1 or 3 years).
  - **Partial Upfront**: Pay part upfront, and the rest monthly.
  - **No Upfront**: Pay monthly over the term of the reservation.

- **Use Case**:

  - Ideal for **long-term workloads** with predictable usage, such as **web hosting** or **enterprise applications**, where you need guaranteed capacity for an extended period.

- **Performance Considerations**:

  - Reserved Instances offer predictable performance, especially for long-term, steady workloads. However, they require a fixed commitment.

- **Modification Notes**:
  - If you change to a larger instance size, you **pay the difference** in cost.
  - If you change to a smaller instance size, **you won‚Äôt get a refund** for the difference, but you will still pay the original cost of the Reserved Instance.

#### **(b) Convertible RIs (Lower Discount) üîÑ**

- **Key Features**:

  - **Up to 54% discount** compared to On-Demand pricing.
  - Flexible to modify the instance **type**, **family**, **OS**, and **tenancy**.
  - You can exchange or modify your Convertible RI based on your changing needs.

  - **All Upfront**: Pay the full amount for the reserved term (1 or 3 years).
  - **Partial Upfront**: Pay part upfront, and the rest monthly.
  - **No Upfront**: Pay monthly over the term of the reservation.

- **Use Case**:

  - Ideal for workloads with **changing requirements** or **future scaling needs**, such as applications where future instance type adjustments are anticipated.

- **Performance Considerations**:

  - Convertible RIs allow for flexibility in terms of instance changes, but the savings are lower compared to Standard RIs.

- **Modification Notes**:
  - Convertible RIs allow more flexibility than Standard RIs. You can modify the instance **type**, **family**, **operating system**, and **tenancy**.
  - If you change to a more expensive instance, you **pay the difference** in price. However, if you change to a cheaper instance, AWS **won‚Äôt refund the difference** but will still charge based on the original cost.
