# **IOPS** and **throughput**


## **Throughput**:
- **Definition**: The amount of data transferred to and from the EBS volume per second.
- **Measured In**: Megabytes per second (MB/s) or Gigabytes per second (GB/s).
- **Focus**: The volume of data.
- **Example**: 500 MB/s means 500 megabytes of data can be transferred per second.

## **IOPS (Input/Output Operations Per Second)**:
- **Definition**: The number of individual I/O operations a system can perform per second.
- **Measured In**: Operations per second.
- **Focus**: The number of read and write operations.
- **Example**: 3,000 IOPS means 3,000 read or write operations can be handled per second.

## Summary
- **Throughput**: Measures the **I/O data volume per second**.
- **IOPS**: Measures the **I/O operations per second**.

Both metrics are crucial for understanding and optimizing the performance of storage systems. Let me know if you have any further questions or need more clarification!
