#### **Authentication methods**

When a user is enabled for SSPR, they must register at least one authentication method.

1. **Email Verification**: Sends a code or link to the user‚Äôs registered email.
1. **SMS/Text Messages**: Delivers a one-time code to the user‚Äôs mobile phone.
1. **Phone Calls**: Provides a verification code via automated calls.
1. **Authenticator Apps**: Uses apps like Microsoft Authenticator for push notifications or code generation.
1. **Security Questions**: Requires answers to predefined questions known only to the user.

Users can only reset their password if they register an authentication method that the administrator has enabled.

#### **Number of authentication methods required**

You can configure the number of the available authentication methods a user must provide to reset or unlock their password. This value can be set to `either one or two`.

Users should register multiple authentication methods so they can sign-in another way if they're unable to access one method.

If a user doesn't register the minimum number of required methods, they see an error page when they try to use SSPR. They need to request that an administrator reset their password.

### 2. **Multi Tenant Environments**

A **multi-tenant environment** in Azure refers to a cloud architecture where a single instance of a software application serves multiple customers (tenants). Each tenant operates in a logically isolated space, ensuring data privacy and security while sharing the same underlying infrastructure and resources. This model is fundamental to many Azure services and applications, enabling scalability, cost-efficiency, and streamlined management.
