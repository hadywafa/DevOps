### Group Accounts

![alt text](images/group-accounts.png)

### Self-Service Password Reset (SSPR)

Microsoft Entra self-service password reset (SSPR) gives users the ability to change or reset their password, with no administrator or help desk involvement. If a user's account is locked or they forget their password, they can follow prompts to unblock themselves and get back to work. This ability reduces help desk calls and loss of productivity when a user can't sign in to their device or an application.

#### Authentication methods

When a user is enabled for SSPR, they must register at least one authentication method.

The following authentication methods are available for SSPR:

1. Mobile app notification
1. Mobile app code
1. Email
1. Mobile phone
1. Office phone (available only for tenants with paid subscriptions)
1. Security questions

Users can only reset their password if they register an authentication method that the administrator has enabled.

#### Number of authentication methods required

You can configure the number of the available authentication methods a user must provide to reset or unlock their password. This value can be set to `either one or two`.

Users should register multiple authentication methods so they can sign-in another way if they're unable to access one method.

If a user doesn't register the minimum number of required methods, they see an error page when they try to use SSPR. They need to request that an administrator reset their password.
