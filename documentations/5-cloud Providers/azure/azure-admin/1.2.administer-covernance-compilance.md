### 1. Managing Subscriptions

Think of an **Azure Subscription** as a **container** that holds all the resources you use in Microsoft Azure. These resources can include virtual machines, databases, storage accounts, and more. Hereâ€™s a straightforward way to understand it:

#### **Key Points:**

- **1. Billing Boundary:**

  - **Definition:** A subscription defines the boundary for billing. This means all the usage and costs for resources are tracked and billed under a specific subscription.
  - **Example:** If your team is working on a project, you might create a separate subscription to easily track and manage the costs associated with that project.

- **2. Resource Mapping:**

  - **Definition:** Any resource you create in Azure is linked to a particular subscription.
  - **Example:** When you create a virtual machine, itâ€™s associated with the subscription youâ€™re currently using in the Azure portal.

- **3. Environmental Boundaries:**

  - **Definition:** Subscriptions help set up boundaries between different environments, such as development, testing, and production.
  - **Example:** You might have one subscription for development and another for production to ensure resources are managed and billed separately.

- **4. Unique Identifier:**

  - **Definition:** Each subscription has a unique ID called a **Subscription ID**.
  - **Purpose:** This ID is used to uniquely identify and manage the subscription within Azure.

- **5. Multiple Subscriptions per Account:**

  - **Definition:** A single Azure account can have multiple subscriptions.
  - **Benefit:** This allows for better organization and management of resources, especially in larger organizations or for different projects.

- **6. Access and Identity:**

  - **Definition:** Users (identities) that are part of Microsoft Entra ID (formerly Azure Active Directory) or other trusted Microsoft cloud services can sign up for and access subscriptions.
  - **Purpose:** This ensures secure and managed access to the resources within each subscription.

- **7. Subscription Types:**

  - **Definition:** Azure offers different types of subscriptions tailored to various use cases.
  - **Purpose:** Choosing the right subscription type helps optimize costs and management based on your specific needs.

- **8. Access Management Scope:**
  - **Definition:** Subscriptions act as a scope for managing who has access to what resources.
  - **Example:** You can assign roles and permissions at the subscription level to control who can create, modify, or delete resources within that subscription.
