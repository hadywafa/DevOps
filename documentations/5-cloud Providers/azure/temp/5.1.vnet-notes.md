# VNet Notes

## What is Difference Between Service Endpoint and Private Link

Great question! While both **Azure Service Endpoints** and **Azure Private Link** allow your Virtual Network (VNet) to securely access Azure services without exposing traffic to the public internet, they do so in different ways with distinct features and benefits. Here's a more detailed comparison to clarify their differences:

### **1. Access Method and Network Integration**

- **Azure Service Endpoints**

  - **Public Endpoint with VNet Integration:** Service Endpoints allow your VNet to access Azure services (like Azure Storage, Azure SQL) over the Azure backbone network by **extending your VNet identity** to the service's **public endpoint**.
  - **No Private IP Assigned:** The Azure service still uses its public IP address, but access is restricted to your VNet or specific subnets within it.

- **Azure Private Link**
  - **Private Endpoint with Private IP:** Private Link creates a **private IP address** within your VNet for the Azure service, effectively bringing the service **inside your VNet**.
  - **No Exposure to Public Endpoints:** The service is accessed **entirely via the private IP**, eliminating the need for public endpoints.

### **2. Security and Isolation**

- **Azure Service Endpoints**

  - **Network-Level Security:** Restricts access to Azure services from specified VNets or subnets using **Azure's backbone network**.
  - **Shared Service Namespace:** The service remains part of the shared Azure service namespace, which means it's still a publicly addressable service, albeit restricted.

- **Azure Private Link**
  - **Enhanced Isolation:** The service appears as a **private resource** within your VNet, providing **strong isolation** from the public internet and other tenants.
  - **Private DNS Integration:** Uses private DNS zones to resolve the service to the private IP, ensuring that DNS queries stay within your private network.

### **3. DNS and Name Resolution**

- **Azure Service Endpoints**

  - **Standard DNS:** You continue to use the standard public DNS names for Azure services (e.g., `*.database.windows.net`), which resolve to their public IPs, but access is restricted to your VNet.

- **Azure Private Link**
  - **Private DNS:** You configure private DNS zones so that the service's DNS name resolves to the **private IP address** within your VNet. This ensures that all traffic remains private.

### **4. Use Cases and Flexibility**

- **Azure Service Endpoints**

  - **Simpler Setup:** Easier to configure for straightforward scenarios where you need secure access to Azure services from your VNet.
  - **Limited to Azure Services:** Primarily designed to connect to Azure PaaS services.

- **Azure Private Link**
  - **Broader Use Cases:** Supports not only Azure PaaS services but also **customer-owned services** and **partner services**, allowing you to expose your own services privately.
  - **Third-Party Integration:** Enables secure access to services hosted by third parties via Private Link Service.

### **5. Pricing**

- **Azure Service Endpoints**

  - **No Additional Cost:** Generally, there are no extra charges for enabling Service Endpoints beyond the standard costs of the services you access.

- **Azure Private Link**
  - **Costs for Private Endpoints:** You incur additional charges for each Private Endpoint you create, which includes both the private connection and data processing fees.

### **6. Compliance and Governance**

- **Azure Service Endpoints**

  - **Basic Compliance:** Suitable for scenarios where standard security and compliance requirements are met by restricting access to VNets.

- **Azure Private Link**
  - **Advanced Compliance:** Ideal for stringent compliance requirements where data must not traverse public endpoints or where complete network isolation is necessary.

### **In Summary:**

- **Azure Service Endpoints**

  - **Pros:** Simple to set up, no extra cost, secures traffic to Azure services over the Azure backbone.
  - **Cons:** Services are still accessed via their public endpoints, offering less isolation.

- **Azure Private Link**
  - **Pros:** Provides a private, isolated connection with private IPs, enhanced security, and broader use cases including custom and third-party services.
  - **Cons:** More complex to set up and incurs additional costs.

### **Visual Analogy:**

- **Service Endpoints:** Imagine having a secure, restricted highway lane from your office (VNet) to a cityâ€™s main service center (Azure service). While the highway is secure and exclusive to your company, the service center itself is still a public building accessible via public addresses.

- **Private Link:** Think of it as having a private tunnel directly connecting your office to the service center, making the service center appear as an extension of your own building complex, entirely isolated from the public.

### **Choosing Between Them:**

- **Choose **Service Endpoints** if:**

  - You need a straightforward way to secure access to Azure services from your VNet.
  - Your security requirements are met by restricting service access to your VNet without needing complete network isolation.

- **Choose **Private Link** if:**
  - You require enhanced security and isolation for accessing Azure services.
  - You need to integrate with custom or third-party services privately.
  - Compliance standards mandate that all traffic remains within your private network without exposure to public endpoints.

## Basic SKU ðŸ†š Standard SKU

- **Region Deployment (Basic SKU)**: The resource is limited to a single region and typically only exists in **one zone** within that region, without redundancy across other zones. If that zone experiences downtime, the resource may be unavailable.

- **Zone-Redundant Deployment (Standard SKU)**: Resources can span **multiple zones** within the same region, providing higher availability and fault tolerance since the failure of one zone does not affect resources in other zones.
