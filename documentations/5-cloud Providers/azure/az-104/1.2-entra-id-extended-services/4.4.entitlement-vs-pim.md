# Entra PIM (Privileged Identity Management)

Both Entra PIM and Entra Entitlement Management do manage access to resources, and they both can use time limitations. However, they serve different purposes and scenarios, which I'll simplify even more:

## Entra PIM (Privileged Identity Management)

- **Who It's For**: Users who need temporary, high-level access to sensitive resources.
- **Purpose**: Manage elevated privileges for specific tasks.
- **Key Features**:
  - **Just-In-Time Access**: Access only when needed, not all the time.
  - **Time-Bound Access**: Automatically revokes access after a set time.
  - **MFA and Approvals**: Requires extra security steps before granting access.
  - **Audit and Reviews**: Keeps a close watch on who accessed what and when.

## Entra Entitlement Management

- **Who It's For**: Any users who need access to a variety of resources, including external users like partners or contractors.
- **Purpose**: Manage ongoing access to various resources.
- **Key Features**:
  - **Access Packages**: Bundles of resources users can request.
  - **Approval Workflows**: Approvals can be customized for different types of access.
  - **Time-Limited and Recurring Reviews**: Ensures users only have access when they need it.
  - **External User Management**: Handles access for people outside your organization.

## Real-World Scenarios

- **Entra PIM**: Think of an IT admin who needs access to a sensitive system for a one-time fix. They get temporary, high-level access that's closely monitored.
- **Entra Entitlement Management**: Think of a new employee who needs ongoing access to various tools and files for their job. They request an access package and get what they need with periodic checks.

So, while both manage access, **Entra PIM** focuses on short-term, high-privilege tasks, and **Entra Entitlement Management** handles broader, ongoing access needs, including for external users.
