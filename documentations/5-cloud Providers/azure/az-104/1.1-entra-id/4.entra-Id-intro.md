## Azure Subscription Relationship

Azure Subscription is the foundation for using Azure services. It acts as a container that holds related resources and allows you to manage and organize them. Here's how it relates to Entra ID:

- **Tenant Association**: Each Azure subscription is linked to a single Entra ID tenant, which provides identity and access management for the subscription. The tenant is where users are created and managed.

- **Subscription to Tenant**:

  - **One-to-One**: Each Azure subscription is linked to one and only one Entra ID tenant. This tenant acts as the identity provider and manages access to the subscription’s resources.

- **Tenant to Subscription**:

  - **One-to-Many**: A single Entra ID tenant can be associated with multiple Azure subscriptions. This allows organizations to organize resources logically, manage costs efficiently, and apply consistent security policies across all subscriptions under the same tenant.

- **Billing**: Subscriptions define the billing model and payment method for the Azure services consumed under it.

- **Resource Organization**: Resources such as virtual machines, databases, and storage accounts are organized within a subscription, which helps in managing costs and access controls.

- **Access Management**: Using Entra ID, administrators can control who has access to resources within a subscription by assigning roles and permissions.

- **Multiple Subscriptions**: Organizations can have multiple subscriptions for different departments or projects, each with its own billing and access control settings.
