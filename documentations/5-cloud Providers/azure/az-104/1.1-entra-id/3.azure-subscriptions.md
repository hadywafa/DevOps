# Azure subscription

An **Azure subscription** is a logical container used to provision resources in Azure. It holds the details of all your resources, including virtual machines, databases, and storage accounts, and defines the boundaries for them.

## Use Cases

- **Development and Testing**:
  - Use a separate subscription for development and testing environments to isolate them from production resources.
- **Cost Management**:
  - Separate subscriptions can help manage and monitor costs for different departments or projects.
- **Security and Compliance**:
  - Use different subscriptions to enforce compliance and security policies as needed for various parts of your organization.

## Key Points

1. **Management Group**:

   - You can organize multiple subscriptions into management groups. This helps in applying policies and managing access at scale.

2. **Billing**:

   - Each subscription is associated with billing and usage. You get a detailed report of the cost and consumption of resources under that subscription.

3. **Access Control**:

   - Subscriptions provide a way to manage access and permissions through role-based access control (RBAC). You can assign users and groups specific roles to control what they can do within the subscription.

4. **Resource Organization**:
   - Resources in Azure are organized by subscriptions, and within each subscription, they can be further organized by resource groups. This helps in managing and logically grouping related resources.
