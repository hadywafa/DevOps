## 🏫 Understanding Azure Tenants <a id="h1"></a>

An **Azure tenant** is a dedicated instance of Microsoft Entra ID (formerly Azure Active Directory) that an organization receives when it signs up for a Microsoft cloud service like Azure, Microsoft 365, or Dynamics 365. It's essentially a container for managing your users, groups, devices, and applications.

### Key Points About Azure Tenant

1. **Identity and Access Management**:

   - The tenant is primarily used for managing identities and access. This includes creating and managing users, groups, roles, and access policies.

2. **Isolation and Security**:

   - Each tenant is isolated, meaning the data and configurations in one tenant are not accessible to another tenant. This ensures security and privacy for your organization's information.

3. **Directory**:

   - The tenant acts as a directory for all users, groups, and other objects related to identity. It's the backbone of identity management for your organization within Microsoft services.

4. **Subscription Association**:

   - A tenant can have multiple subscriptions associated with it. Each subscription is linked to only one tenant, but a tenant can manage several subscriptions. This allows for organized management and billing of resources.

5. **Domain**:
   - When you set up a tenant, it's typically linked to a specific domain name (e.g., `contoso.onmicrosoft.com`). You can also add custom domain names associated with your organization.

### **Who Creates a Tenant?**

- **Initial Creation**:
  - **When You Sign Up for Azure**: A new tenant is automatically created when you sign up for Azure or any Microsoft cloud service.
  - **Self-Service Creation**: Users with appropriate permissions can create additional tenants via the **Microsoft 365 admin center** or **Azure portal**.

### **How to Create a Tenant**

`you must have p1 or p2 license for entra ID to be able create tenants than your default one`

1. **Through Azure Portal**:

   - Navigate to **Microsoft Entra ID** in the Azure portal.
   - Select **Manage**.
   - Select **Create a tenant**.
   - Choose **Azure Active Directory** and follow the prompts to set up the new tenant.

2. **Through Microsoft 365 Admin Center**:
   - Go to the **Admin Center**.
   - Select **Settings** > **Org settings** > **Azure Active Directory**.
   - Follow the steps to create a new tenant.

### **Ownership of a Tenant**

- **Global Administrator**:
  - The user who creates the tenant is designated as the **Global Administrator**.
  - **Responsibilities**:
    - Manage all aspects of Entra ID.
    - Assign roles and permissions.
    - Configure policies and security settings.
- **Co-Administrators**:
  - Global Administrators can assign other users as **Co-Administrators** to share administrative responsibilities.

### **Can a User Belong to Multiple Tenants?**

**Yes**, a single Azure account (also known as a **Microsoft Account** or **Work/School Account**) can be associated with multiple tenants. This allows users to access resources across different organizations or departments.

### **Types of User Roles Across Tenants**

1. **Member User**:

   - **Definition**: A regular user within the tenant.
   - **Permissions**: Access to resources based on assigned roles within that specific tenant.

2. **Guest User**:

   - **Definition**: A user invited from another tenant to collaborate.
   - **Permissions**: Limited access, typically defined by the inviting tenant’s policies.
   - **Usage**: Ideal for external partners, contractors, or collaborators.

3. **External User**:
   - **Similar to Guest User**: Users from outside the tenant who have been granted access to specific resources.

### **Privileges Across Multiple Tenants**

- **Distinct Permissions**:

  - A user’s role and permissions are **tenant-specific**.
  - Being a **Global Administrator** in one tenant does **not** grant any privileges in another tenant.

- **Example**:
  - **User A** is a **Global Administrator** in **Tenant X** (Finance) and a **Contributor** in **Tenant Y** (HR).
  - **User A** can manage all aspects in Tenant X but has limited, resource-specific permissions in Tenant Y.

## 🔄 Switching Between Tenants <a id="h4"></a>

Azure allows users to **switch between tenants** seamlessly within the Azure portal or Microsoft 365 services.

### **How to Switch Tenants**

1. **Azure Portal**:

   - Click on your account name in the top-right corner.
   - Select **Switch Directory**.
   - Choose the desired tenant from the list.

2. **Microsoft 365 Portal**:
   - Similar steps as in the Azure portal to switch between different directories (tenants).

### **Managing Multiple Tenants**

- **Default Tenant**:

  - When you sign in, you are connected to your **default tenant**.
  - You can switch to other tenants as needed without signing out.

- **Visibility**:
  - Only tenants where the user has some form of access (Member or Guest) are visible for switching.

## 🛡️ Managing Permissions Across Tenants <a id="h5"></a>

Effective permission management is crucial when dealing with multiple tenants. Here’s how to handle it:

### **Role Assignments**

- **Tenant-Specific Roles**:

  - Roles such as **Global Administrator**, **User Administrator**, **Contributor**, etc., are assigned within the context of each tenant.

- **Granular Control**:
  - Assign roles based on the principle of **least privilege**, ensuring users have only the access they need.

### **Azure AD B2B Collaboration**

- **Guest Access**:
  - Use **Azure AD B2B** to invite external users as guests.
  - Define specific permissions and access levels for these guests.

### **Conditional Access Policies**

- **Enhanced Security**:
  - Implement **Conditional Access** policies per tenant to control how and when users can access resources.
  - Examples include requiring **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)** or restricting access based on **location**.

### **Azure Lighthouse**

- **Managing Multiple Tenants**:
  - **Azure Lighthouse** allows service providers or centralized IT teams to manage multiple tenants from a single control plane.
  - **Benefits**:
    - Streamlined management.
    - Enhanced security through delegated resource management.

## 🛗 Cross-Tenant Collaboration <a id="h6"></a>

Collaboration across tenants enables seamless interaction between different organizations while maintaining security boundaries.

### **Inviting External Users**

1. **Send an Invitation**:

   - Use **Azure AD B2B** to invite external users by sending them an invitation link.

2. **User Accepts Invitation**:
   - The invited user accepts and gains access as a **Guest** in the inviting tenant.

### **Accessing Shared Resources**

- **Share Applications**:

  - Applications can be shared across tenants, allowing guest users to access them based on their roles.

- **Share Files and Data**:
  - Use services like **SharePoint**, **OneDrive**, or **Azure Storage** with appropriate sharing settings.

### **Collaborative Tools**

- **Microsoft Teams**:

  - Facilitates collaboration with users from different tenants by creating **guest-enabled teams**.

- **Azure DevOps**:
  - Share projects and repositories with users from other tenants, managing their access through Azure AD roles.

## 💡 Key Points to Remember <a id="h7"></a>

1. **Tenants Represent Organizations**:

   - Each tenant is a separate organization with its own Entra ID instance.

2. **Users Can Belong to Multiple Tenants**:

   - A single Azure account can access multiple tenants, each with distinct roles and permissions.

3. **Roles Are Tenant-Specific**:

   - User roles and permissions do not carry over between tenants; they must be managed individually per tenant.

4. **Guest Users Have Limited Access**:

   - Guest users from other tenants have access defined by the inviting tenant, ensuring security and control.

5. **Azure Lighthouse Simplifies Multi-Tenant Management**:

   - Ideal for service providers or centralized IT teams managing multiple organizations.

6. **Effective Permission Management Is Crucial**:
   - Implement RBAC, Conditional Access, and other security measures to protect resources across tenants.

## 📌 Summary <a id="h8"></a>

**Azure’s multi-tenant architecture** allows a single Azure account to interact with multiple tenants (organizations), each with its own set of resources, policies, and access controls. Here’s a concise recap:

1. **🏫 Tenant (Organization)**:

   - Represents a single organization within Azure, managed through Entra ID.
   - Created automatically when signing up for Azure or can be created manually.

2. **💼 Creating and Owning a Tenant**:

   - Tenants are created by users signing up for Azure or through the admin centers.
   - The creator becomes the **Global Administrator**, owning the tenant.

3. **👤 Users and Multi-Tenancy**:

   - Users can belong to multiple tenants, holding different roles and permissions in each.
   - Roles are tenant-specific and do not overlap across tenants.

4. **👨‍💻 🏬 Switching Between Tenants**:

   - Users can switch between tenants within the Azure or Microsoft 365 portals without signing out.

5. **🛡️ Managing Permissions Across Tenants**:

   - Use RBAC, Azure AD B2B, Conditional Access, and Azure Lighthouse to manage permissions and access effectively.

6. **🛗 Cross-Tenant Collaboration**:
   - Invite external users as guests to collaborate while maintaining security boundaries.

**Key Takeaways**:

- **Tenants are the core organizational boundaries** in Azure, each with its own Entra ID instance.
- **Users can access multiple tenants** with roles and permissions specific to each tenant.
- **Proper management and security** practices are essential to maintain control and protect resources across multiple tenants.
- **Tools like Azure Lighthouse** facilitate efficient management of multiple tenants, especially for service providers.
