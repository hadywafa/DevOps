# Azure Storage Data Transfer Tools

Azure provides tools to move data to and from Azure Storage. These tools help transfer small and large datasets securely and reliably.

## Key Tools

### 1. Custom Disk Import/Export Service

- **Overview**: You send your own hard drives (HDDs or SSDs) to Microsoft, and they upload your data into Azure. This is great if your internet is slow or unstable.
- **How It Works**:
  1. Use a tool to prepare your disk.
  2. Encrypt your disk for safety.
  3. Ship your disk to Microsoft.
  4. Microsoft uploads the data to your Azure account.
- **Command Example**:

  ```bash
  waimportexport prepimport /j:<journal-file-path> /id:<job-id> /sk:<storage-account-key>
  ```

- **Why Use It**:
  - Move large amounts of data.
  - Keep sensitive data safe during transfer.

### 2. Azure Data Box

- **Overview**: Microsoft sends you a special device (a "Data Box") to copy your data onto. You return it, and they upload the data to Azure.
- **How It Works**:
  1. Order the Data Box.
  2. Copy your data onto it.
  3. Ship it back to Microsoft.
  4. They upload your data to Azure.
- **Why Use It**:
  - For massive data (terabytes or petabytes).
  - To avoid using internet for transfer.

### 3. AzCopy
