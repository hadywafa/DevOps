# Azure Storage Encryption

**Azure Storage Encryption** automatically encrypts data before storing it and decrypts it during retrieval, ensuring that data remains secure while at rest. Encryption helps protect your data from unauthorized access and fulfills compliance requirements for data protection.

- **Encryption at Rest:** Protects data stored on disk.
- **Transparent Encryption:** Encryption and decryption processes are seamless and do not require changes to your applications.

## Types of Storage Encryption

Azure provides two primary encryption methods to protect your data:

### **1. Server-Side Encryption (SSE)**

**Server-Side Encryption** encrypts your data on the server before it is persisted to Azure Storage and decrypts it when accessed. This process is managed entirely by Azure, requiring no additional configuration from the user.

- **Automatic Encryption:** Data is encrypted automatically upon upload.
- **Supported Services:** Blob Storage, File Storage, Queue Storage, and Table Storage.
- **Encryption Algorithms:** AES-256 is used for encryption.

#### **Subtypes of SSE:**

- **SSE with Microsoft-Managed Keys (SSE-MSK):** Azure manages the encryption keys.
- **SSE with Customer-Managed Keys (SSE-CMK):** You provide and manage your own encryption keys using Azure Key Vault.

### **2. Client-Side Encryption (CSE)**

**Client-Side Encryption** allows you to encrypt data on the client-side before uploading it to Azure Storage. Decryption occurs on the client-side when retrieving the data.

- **Full Control:** You manage the encryption and decryption processes.
- **Encryption Libraries:** Utilize Azure SDKs or other encryption libraries.
- **Use Cases:** Scenarios requiring end-to-end encryption and full control over encryption keys.

### Storage Account Types

To utilize **Azure Storage Encryption**, you must use the appropriate storage account type that supports encryption features:

- **General-purpose v2 (GPv2) Storage Accounts:**

  - Supports all Azure Storage features, including SSE and CSE.
  - Recommended for most scenarios requiring comprehensive storage solutions.

- **BlockBlobStorage Accounts:**
  - Optimized for workloads requiring high throughput and low latency.
  - Supports SSE and is ideal for block blob storage scenarios.

**Note:** Immutable storage features are available in GPv2 and BlockBlobStorage accounts but not in General-purpose v1 or BlobStorage accounts.

### Encryption Keys and Key Management

Managing encryption keys is critical for maintaining data security. Azure offers several options:

- **Microsoft-Managed Keys (SSE-MSK):**

  - Azure handles key management, rotation, and security.

- **Customer-Managed Keys (SSE-CMK):**

  - You create and manage encryption keys using **Azure Key Vault**.
  - Provides greater control and flexibility over key management.

- **Client-Side Encryption Keys (CSE):**
  - Managed entirely on the client-side.
  - You retain full control over encryption and decryption processes.

**Azure Key Vault** is integral for managing customer-managed keys, providing secure storage and access policies for encryption keys.

## Implementing Azure Storage Encryption

Azure Storage Encryption can be implemented using the **Azure Portal**, **Azure CLI**, or **Azure PowerShell**. Below are the steps for each encryption type.

### A. Server-Side Encryption

#### Using Azure Portal

1. **Navigate to Storage Account:**

   - Go to the [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com/).
   - Click on **"Storage Accounts"** and select your storage account.

2. **Access Encryption Settings:**

   - In the storage account's menu, scroll down to **"Data protection"**.
   - Click on **"Encryption"**.

3. **Configure Encryption:**

   - **Service Encryption:** Ensure that **"Microsoft managed keys"** is selected for SSE-MSK.
   - **Customer-Managed Keys (Optional):**
     - Select **"Customer managed keys"**.
     - Choose your **Key Vault** and **Key** from the dropdown menus.

4. **Save Settings:**
   - Click **"Save"** to apply the encryption settings.

#### Using Azure CLI

```bash
# Log in to Azure
az login

# Enable SSE with Microsoft-Managed Keys
az storage account update \
  --name <StorageAccount> \
  --resource-group <ResourceGroup> \
  --encryption-services blob,file \
  --encryption-key-source Microsoft.Storage
```

**Example:**

```bash
az storage account update \
  --name mystorageaccount \
  --resource-group myresourcegroup \
  --encryption-services blob,file \
  --encryption-key-source Microsoft.Storage
```

### B. Client-Side Encryption

#### Using Azure SDKs

Client-side encryption typically involves using Azure SDKs to encrypt data before uploading it to Azure Storage. Below is an example using the Azure Storage Blobs SDK for .NET.

##### Example: .NET

```csharp
using Azure.Storage.Blobs;
using Azure.Storage.Blobs.Specialized;
using System.Security.Cryptography;
using System.Text;

// Initialize Blob Client
BlobServiceClient blobServiceClient = new BlobServiceClient(connectionString);
BlobContainerClient containerClient = blobServiceClient.GetBlobContainerClient("mycontainer");

// Generate Encryption Key
byte[] key = new byte[32]; // 256-bit key
using (var rng = RandomNumberGenerator.Create())
{
    rng.GetBytes(key);
}

// Initialize Blob Client with Encryption Policy
BlobClient blobClient = containerClient.GetBlobClient("myblob.txt");
BlockBlobClient blockBlobClient = blobClient.GetBlockBlobClient();

// Upload Encrypted Data
string data = "Sensitive data to encrypt";
byte[] encryptedData = EncryptData(Encoding.UTF8.GetBytes(data), key);

using (var stream = new MemoryStream(encryptedData))
{
    blockBlobClient.Upload(stream, overwrite: true);
}

// Encryption Method
static byte[] EncryptData(byte[] data, byte[] key)
{
    using Aes aes = Aes.Create();
    aes.Key = key;
    aes.GenerateIV();
    using var encryptor = aes.CreateEncryptor(aes.Key, aes.IV);
    using var ms = new MemoryStream();
    ms.Write(aes.IV, 0, aes.IV.Length); // Prepend IV
    using var cs = new CryptoStream(ms, encryptor, CryptoStreamMode.Write);
    cs.Write(data, 0, data.Length);
    cs.FlushFinalBlock();
    return ms.ToArray();
}
```

**Note:** Ensure that encryption keys are securely stored and managed, preferably using **Azure Key Vault**.

## Benefits

5. **Monitor Encryption Status:**

   - Use Azure Monitor and Azure Security Center to track encryption status and detect any anomalies.

6. **Backup Encryption Keys:**

   - Maintain backups of your encryption keys to prevent data loss in case of key vault issues.

7. **Adopt the Principle of Least Privilege:**

   - Grant only necessary permissions to users and applications interacting with storage accounts and key vaults.

8. **Audit and Compliance:**
   - Regularly audit encryption settings and key management practices to ensure compliance with organizational policies and regulations.
