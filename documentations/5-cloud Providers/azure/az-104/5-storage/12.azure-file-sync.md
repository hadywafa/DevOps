1. **Centralized Storage**: Synchronizes multiple file servers with a single Azure file share.
2. **Cloud Tiering**: Automatically offloads infrequently accessed files to Azure, reducing local storage costs.
3. **Multi-Site Access**: Ensures consistent file access across multiple on-premises locations.
4. **Disaster Recovery**: Provides a built-in backup solution by replicating server data to Azure.
5. **Integration**: Works with Azure Backup for comprehensive data protection.

## How It Works
