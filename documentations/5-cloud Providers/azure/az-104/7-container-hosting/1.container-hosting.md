               - containerPort: 80
   ```

2. **Apply the Blue Deployment:**

   ```bash
   kubectl apply -f blue-deployment.yaml
   ```

3. **Create a Service to Route Traffic to Blue:**

   ```yaml
   # service.yaml
   apiVersion: v1
   kind: Service
   metadata:
     name: myapp-service
   spec:
     selector:
       app: myapp
     ports:
       - protocol: TCP
         port: 80
         targetPort: 80
     type: LoadBalancer
   ```

4. **Apply the Service:**

   ```bash
   kubectl apply -f service.yaml
   ```

5. **Deploy the New Version (Green):**

   ```yaml
   # green-deployment.yaml
   apiVersion: apps/v1
   kind: Deployment
   metadata:
     name: myapp-green
   spec:
     replicas: 3
     selector:
       matchLabels:
         app: myapp
         version: green
     template:
       metadata:
         labels:
           app: myapp
           version: green
       spec:
         containers:
           - name: myapp
             image: myacr.azurecr.io/myapp:green
             ports:
               - containerPort: 80
   ```

6. **Apply the Green Deployment:**

   ```bash
   kubectl apply -f green-deployment.yaml
   ```

7. **Switch Traffic to Green:**

   Update the service selector to route traffic to the green version.

   ```yaml
   # service-update.yaml
   apiVersion: v1
   kind: Service
   metadata:
     name: myapp-service
   spec:
     selector:
       app: myapp
       version: green
     ports:
       - protocol: TCP
         port: 80
         targetPort: 80
     type: LoadBalancer
   ```

8. **Apply the Service Update:**

   ```bash
   kubectl apply -f service-update.yaml
   ```

9. **Verify the Deployment:**

   Ensure that traffic is now routed to the green version of the application. Monitor for any issues before decommissioning the blue deployment.
