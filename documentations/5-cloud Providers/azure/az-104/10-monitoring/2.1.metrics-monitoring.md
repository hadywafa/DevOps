# **Azure Metrics Monitoring Overview**

Azure Metrics Monitoring is a feature of Azure Monitor that collects numerical data from your Azure resources into a time-series database. These metrics help you understand the performance, health, and usage of your resources.

## **Types of Metrics**

1. **Platform Metrics**
2. **Custom Metrics**
3. **Prometheus Metrics**

### **1. Platform Metrics**

**Definition**: Metrics collected automatically by Azure from your resources without any additional configuration.

**Examples**:

- **CPU Usage**: Measures the percentage of CPU resources used by your resource.
- **Memory Usage**: Tracks the amount of memory used by your resource.
- **Disk I/O**: Monitors the input/output operations on your disks.
- **Network Traffic**: Measures the amount of data sent and received by your resource.

**Example Scenario**:
Imagine you have an Azure Virtual Machine (VM). Platform metrics will automatically collect data like CPU usage, memory usage, and disk I/O, giving you insights into the VM's performance without any extra setup.

### **2. Custom Metrics**

**Definition**: Metrics that you define and collect from your applications, services, or agents running on your resources.

**Examples**:

- **Application Response Time**: Measures how long it takes for your application to respond to requests.
- **Custom Business Metrics**: Metrics specific to your business, such as the number of transactions or user engagement.

**Agent Options:**

1. **Azure Diagnostics Extension:** Collects detailed diagnostics data from your VMs.
1. **Log Analytics Agent (formerly OMS Agent):** Sends detailed metrics and logs to Azure Monitor Logs (Log Analytics).

**Example Scenario**:
If you have a web application running on Azure, you can use Application Insights to collect custom metrics like response time and error rates, helping you monitor and optimize your application's performance.

### **3. Prometheus Metrics**

**Definition**: Metrics collected from Kubernetes clusters, including Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS), using Prometheus and Grafana for analysis and alerting.

**Examples**:

- **Pod CPU Usage**: Measures the CPU usage of individual pods in your Kubernetes cluster.
- **Container Memory Usage**: Tracks the memory usage of containers within your pods.

**Example Scenario**:
In an AKS environment, Prometheus collects metrics like pod CPU usage and container memory usage, which can be visualized and analyzed using Grafana dashboards to monitor the health and performance of your Kubernetes cluster.

## **Visualizing Metrics**

Azure Monitor provides tools to visualize and analyze these metrics:

- **Metrics Explorer**: A tool in the Azure portal that allows you to create charts and dashboards for your metrics.
- **Workbooks**: Interactive reports that combine data from different sources and provide rich visualizations.
- **Grafana**: An open-source visualization tool that can be integrated with Azure Monitor for advanced analysis and alerting.

## **Example Use Cases**

- **Performance Monitoring**: Use platform metrics to monitor the health and performance of your Azure resources.
- **Troubleshooting**: Use custom metrics to identify and resolve issues in your applications.
- **Cost Management**: Track resource usage metrics to optimize costs and ensure efficient resource utilization.
- **Compliance**: Collect and store metrics to meet regulatory requirements and audit trails.

## **Steps to Set Up Metrics Monitoring**

1. **Navigate to Azure Portal**: Go to the Azure portal and select the resource you want to monitor.
2. **Select Metrics**: Under the "Monitoring" section, find and select "Metrics."
3. **Create Charts**: Use Metrics Explorer to create charts for the metrics you want to monitor.
4. **Set Up Alerts**: Configure alerts to notify you when specific metrics exceed or fall below thresholds.
5. **Visualize Data**: Use Workbooks or Grafana to create detailed visualizations and reports.

## **Summary**

Azure Metrics Monitoring provides a comprehensive solution for tracking the performance and health of your Azure resources. By leveraging platform metrics, custom metrics, and Prometheus metrics, you can gain valuable insights and ensure your applications and services run smoothly.

Imagine you have an Azure VM running a web server. By default, you'll get platform metrics such as CPU usage and network traffic without installing any agents. However, if you want detailed metrics like memory usage per process or specific disk performance details, you'll need to install an agent.

This approach allows you to get a comprehensive view of both the high-level performance of your VMs through platform metrics and detailed insights through operating system metrics collected by agents.
