# **Azure Monitor Logs**

**Azure Monitor Logs** is a centralized platform for collecting, analyzing, and acting on telemetry data generated by both Azure and non-Azure resources and applications. Here are some key points:

## **Key Components**

- **Data Collection**: Azure Monitor Logs collects data from various sources, including applications, operating systems, and devices. This data can be ingested in real-time or in batches.

- **Log Analytics Workspace**: The primary resource in Azure Monitor Logs is the **Log Analytics workspace**, which is a data store that holds tables into which you collect data. You can manage and optimize log data and costs within this workspace.

- **Data Transformation**: You can transform data based on your needs, such as optimizing costs, removing personal data, and routing data to tables in your Log Analytics workspace.

- **Querying Data**: You can retrieve data using the **Kusto Query Language (KQL)**, which allows for powerful and flexible querying capabilities. There are also tools and features that don't require KQL knowledge, like the Simple mode in the Log Analytics user interface.

- **Use Cases**: Azure Monitor Logs can be used for a variety of purposes, including troubleshooting, alerting, dashboards, reports, and custom applications.

## Implementing Azure Monitor Logs for an Azure Virtual Machine

Let's walk through a simple demo to set up Azure Monitor Logs for an Azure Virtual Machine (VM). This will help you monitor the VM's performance and receive alerts if any issues arise.

### Step 1: Create a Log Analytics Workspace

1. **Log in to Azure Portal:**

   - Go to [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com/) and sign in with your Azure account.

2. **Create a Workspace:**

   - Click on **"Create a resource"**.
   - Search for **"Log Analytics Workspace"** and select it.
   - Click **"Create"**.

3. **Configure Workspace:**
   - **Subscription:** Choose your Azure subscription.
   - **Resource Group:** Select an existing resource group or create a new one.
   - **Name:** Enter a name for your workspace (e.g., `MyLogAnalyticsWorkspace`).
   - **Region:** Choose the same region as your VM for better performance.
   - Click **"Review + create"** and then **"Create"**.

### Step 2: Connect Your Azure VM to the Workspace

1. **Navigate to the VM:**

   - In the Azure Portal, go to **"Virtual Machines"** and select the VM you want to monitor.

2. **Enable Monitoring:**

   - In the VM's menu, under **"Monitoring"**, click on **"Insights"**.
   - If prompted, click **"Enable"** to set up monitoring.

3. **Select Workspace:**
   - Choose the **Log Analytics Workspace** you created earlier (`MyLogAnalyticsWorkspace`).
   - Click **"Apply"** to connect the VM to the workspace.

### Step 3: Configure Data Collection

1. **Go to Log Analytics Workspace:**

   - In the Azure Portal, navigate to **"Log Analytics Workspaces"** and select `MyLogAnalyticsWorkspace`.

2. **Configure Data Sources:**
   - Click on **"Agents management"**.
   - Under **"Windows Servers"** or **"Linux Servers"**, ensure that your VM is listed and data collection is enabled.
   - You can customize which logs and metrics to collect based on your needs.

### Step 4: Analyze and Visualize Logs

1. **Access Logs:**

   - In the **Log Analytics Workspace**, click on **"Logs"** under the **"General"** section.

2. **Run a Query:**

   - Use Kusto Query Language (KQL) to search and analyze your logs.
   - **Example Query:** To get CPU usage for your VM:
     ```kql
     Perf
     | where ObjectName == "Processor" and CounterName == "% Processor Time" and InstanceName == "_Total"
     | summarize avg(CounterValue) by bin(TimeGenerated, 5m)
     | render timechart
     ```
   - This query calculates the average CPU usage every 5 minutes and displays it as a time chart.

3. **Create a Dashboard:**
   - Click on **"Pin to dashboard"** to add the query results to your Azure dashboard for easy monitoring.

### Step 5: Set Up Alerts

1. **Define an Alert Rule:**

   - In the **Log Analytics Workspace**, go to **"Alerts"** and click **"New alert rule"**.

2. **Select Resource:**

   - Choose the **Log Analytics Workspace** as the resource.

3. **Configure Condition:**

   - Click on **"Add condition"**.
   - Use a query to define the alert criteria. For example, to alert when CPU usage is over 80%:
     ```kql
     Perf
     | where ObjectName == "Processor" and CounterName == "% Processor Time" and InstanceName == "_Total"
     | summarize avg(CounterValue) by bin(TimeGenerated, 5m)
     | where avg_CounterValue > 80
     ```

4. **Set Alert Details:**

   - **Alert Logic:** Define how often the condition should be checked.
   - **Action Group:** Specify who should be notified (e.g., email, SMS).

5. **Review and Create:**
   - Review your alert settings and click **"Create alert rule"**.

## Summary
