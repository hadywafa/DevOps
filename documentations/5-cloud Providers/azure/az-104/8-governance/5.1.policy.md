## Implementation Overview

Setting up Azure Policy is like creating a rulebook for your household to keep everything in order. You define the rules (policy definitions), apply them to specific areas (assignments), and continuously check if everything follows the rules (compliance tracking). Here's a simple way to understand how it works:

1. **Create Policy Definitions:** Define the rules that your Azure resources should follow.
2. **Assign Policies:** Apply these rules to specific scopes like subscriptions or resource groups.
3. **Monitor Compliance:** Use the compliance dashboard to see which resources meet the rules and which don't.
4. **Remediate Non-compliance:** Automatically fix resources that don't comply with the policies.
5. **Review and Update:** Regularly update your policies to adapt to new requirements or changes in your environment.

   - **50% Threshold:**
     - **Alert Name:** `50% of Budget`
     - **Threshold:** `50%`
     - **Action Group:** Select an existing action group or create a new one.
   - **75% Threshold:**
     - **Alert Name:** `75% of Budget`
     - **Threshold:** `75%`
     - **Action Group:** Select an existing action group or create a new one.
   - **90% Threshold:**
     - **Alert Name:** `90% of Budget`
     - **Threshold:** `90%`
     - **Action Group:** Select an existing action group or create a new one.

2. **Create or Select an Action Group:**

   - **Action Group Name:** `BudgetAlerts`
   - **Actions:** Configure notifications (e.g., email, SMS) for the relevant stakeholders.
   - Click **"OK"** to save the action group.

3. **Review and Create Budget:**

   - Upon receiving alerts, review your Azure usage.
   - Optimize resources, shut down unnecessary services, or adjust your budget as needed to stay within limits.

## Important Considerations

### Notes and Tips

- **Policy Inheritance:** Policies assigned at a higher scope (e.g., subscription) are inherited by all resources within that scope, ensuring consistent enforcement.
- **Exemptions:** You can exempt specific resources or resource groups from certain policies if necessary.
- **Audit vs. Enforce:** Use the **"Audit"** effect to monitor compliance without enforcing rules, which is useful for tracking and reporting before strict enforcement.
- **Compliance Reports:** Regularly review compliance reports to identify and address non-compliant resources proactively.
- **Versioning:** Keep your policy definitions updated to incorporate new best practices and organizational changes.

### Common Pitfalls

- **Overly Restrictive Policies:** Setting policies that are too strict can hinder productivity. Ensure policies balance security and operational needs.
- **Lack of Tagging Strategy:** Without a clear tagging strategy, enforcing and tracking policies can become challenging. Define and implement consistent tags across all resources.
- **Ignoring Compliance Reports:** Regularly ignoring compliance reports can lead to unmanaged risks and inefficiencies. Make it a habit to review and act on these reports.
