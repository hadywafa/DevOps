![Application Registration Diagram](images/app-identity.png)

## **Introduction**

**Application Registrations** in Azure Entra ID enable you to integrate external or internal applications with your organization's identity and access management system. This integration allows applications to authenticate, authorize, and securely access your organization's resources.

- Helps control both access to an app, and the access an app has to other resources.
- The app itself can reside anywhere, inside or outside of azure.
- Application must registered within an Entra ID tenant (Application Registration).

## **Key Components of Application Registrations**

### 1. **Application ID (Client ID)**

- **Description:** A unique identifier assigned to each registered application.
- **Use Case:** Used by applications to identify themselves when requesting access to resources.

### 2. **Redirect URIs**

- **Description:** URLs where authentication responses are sent and received by the application.
- **Use Case:** Define where your application expects to receive authentication tokens after sign-in.

### 3. **Certificates & Secrets**

- **Client Secret:**
  - **Description:** A password-like string used by the application to authenticate.
  - **Use Case:** Used in confidential client flows where the application can securely store the secret.
- **Certificates:**
  - **Description:** Public key infrastructure (PKI) certificates used for authentication.
  - **Use Case:** Provide a more secure alternative to client secrets, especially for high-security applications.

### 4. **API Permissions**

- **Description:** Define what resources and operations the application can access.
- **Types:**
  - **Delegated Permissions:** Access on behalf of a signed-in user.
  - **Application Permissions:** Access without a user context, suitable for background services or daemons.

### 5. **Roles and Scopes**

- **Description:** Define specific permissions and access levels for applications.
- **Use Case:** Control granular access to resources based on roles and scopes assigned to the application.

### **Lifecycle Relationship**

1. **App Registration:**

   - **Action:** Register an application via **App Registrations**.
   - **Result:** Creates an **Application Object** in your Azure Entra ID tenant.

2. **Enterprise Application:**
   - **Action:** Once an application is registered, a **Service Principal** is automatically created in the **Enterprise Applications** section.
   - **Result:** Allows administrators to manage how the application is accessed and used within the organization.

### **Roles and Responsibilities**

- **Developers:**

  - Handle **App Registrations** to set up application configurations, authentication methods, and API integrations.

- **IT Administrators:**
  - Manage **Enterprise Applications** to control user access, enforce security policies, assign roles, and monitor application usage.

### **Security and Access Control**

- **App Registrations:**

  - Focus on defining **how** an application authenticates and what resources it can access.

- **Enterprise Applications:**
  - Focus on **who** in the organization can access the application and **how** they authenticate (e.g., via SSO, Conditional Access).

### **Integration with Azure AD App Gallery**

- **App Registrations:**

  - Primarily for **custom** and **in-house** applications that your organization develops or integrates.

- **Enterprise Applications:**
  - Includes both **custom applications** (from App Registrations) and **pre-integrated applications** from the **Azure AD App Gallery**, providing a centralized management interface for all applications your organization uses.

## **Managed Identities in Detail**

**Managed Identities** provide an identity for applications to use when connecting to resources that support Azure AD authentication. They eliminate the need for developers to manage credentials, enhancing security and simplifying identity management.
