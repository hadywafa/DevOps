# **Backup** ðŸ†š **Site Recovery**

Both **backup** and **site recovery** are essential for a comprehensive disaster recovery plan, addressing different aspects of data protection and system availability. Combining both strategies ensures that you can recover individual files and maintain business operations during larger-scale incidents.

## Backup

**Purpose**:

- Protects data from corruption, accidental deletion, or hardware failure.

**How It Works**:

- Creates regular snapshots or copies of data stored in a safe location (on-premises, cloud, or both).
- Restores data to its previous state in the event of data loss or corruption.

**Key Features**:

- **Frequency**: Scheduled backups (daily, weekly, etc.).
- **Retention**: Multiple versions of data kept according to defined policies.
- **Recovery**: Restores files, databases, or entire virtual machines (VMs) from the backup.

**Use Cases**:

- Protecting against data loss due to accidental deletion, ransomware, or corruption.
- Meeting compliance requirements for data retention.

## Site Recovery

**Purpose**:

- Ensures business continuity by replicating entire systems and applications to a secondary location, allowing for rapid failover in the event of a major disruption.

**How It Works**:

- Continuously replicates systems, applications, and data to a secondary site (often geographically distant).
- Enables quick failover to the secondary site to maintain operations during a site-wide failure.

**Key Features**:

- **Replication**: Continuous or near-continuous replication.
- **Failover**: Automated or manual failover to a secondary site.
- **Failback**: Ability to revert back to the primary site once it is operational again.

**Use Cases**:

- Ensuring business continuity during major disasters or outages.
- Maintaining high availability for critical applications.

## Summary

**Backup**:

- **Focus**: Data protection.
- **Method**: Creates copies of data at regular intervals.
- **Use**: Restores lost or corrupted data.

**Site Recovery**:

- **Focus**: Business continuity.
- **Method**: Replicates entire systems and applications to a secondary site.
- **Use**: Quick failover to a secondary site during major disruptions.
