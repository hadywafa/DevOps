# Azure Site Recovery Demos

## Demo 1. Configure ASR for Hybrid (On-premises to Azure)

### Overview

Imagine you have important toys (data) in your home (on-premises) and you want to keep a safe copy of them in a friend's house (Azure) in case something happens to your home. **Azure Site Recovery (ASR)** helps you do just that by copying your data from your local environment to Azure.

### Steps to Configure ASR

#### 1. Create a Recovery Services Vault

- **What to Do:** Set up a secure storage area in Azure where all your backup data will be kept.
- **Why:** This vault acts as the central hub for managing your backups and recovery processes.
- **How:**
  - Log in to the [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com/).
  - Click on **"Create a resource"**.
  - Search for **"Recovery Services Vault"** and select it.
  - Click **"Create"** and fill in the required details like **Name**, **Resource Group**, and **Location**.
  - Click **"Review + create"** and then **"Create"**.

#### 2. Install and Configure the ASR Agent on On-premises VMs

- **What to Do:** Install the Azure Site Recovery (ASR) agent on your on-premises virtual machines (VMs).
- **Why:** The agent allows Azure to communicate with your on-premises VMs and manage their backups.
- **How:**
  - In the **Recovery Services Vault**, navigate to **"Site Recovery"**.
  - Click **"Prepare Infrastructure"** and follow the wizard to download the ASR agent.
  - Install the agent on each on-premises VM you want to protect by following the installation prompts.

#### 3. Define Replication Settings

- **What to Do:** Set up how often your VMs should be backed up and where the backups should be stored in Azure.
- **Why:** Proper settings ensure your data is backed up regularly and can be recovered when needed.
- **How:**
  - In the **Recovery Services Vault**, go to **"Replicate Application"**.
  - Choose the source (on-premises) and target (Azure) environments.
  - Select the VMs you want to replicate.
  - Define the replication policy, including the frequency of backups and retention periods.

#### 4. Start Replicating VMs to Azure

- **What to Do:** Begin the process of copying your on-premises VMs to Azure.
- **Why:** This creates a backup copy of your VMs in Azure, ready for recovery in case of issues.
- **How:**
  - After configuring replication settings, click **"Replicate"** to start the initial replication process.
  - Monitor the replication progress in the **"Replication Jobs"** section of the vault.

#### 5. Test the Failover

- **What to Do:** Perform a test failover to make sure everything works correctly.
- **Why:** Testing ensures that you can successfully recover your VMs in Azure if something goes wrong with the originals.
- **How:**
  - In the **Recovery Services Vault**, select the VM you want to test.
  - Click **"Test Failover"** and choose a recovery point.
  - Azure will create a temporary VM in Azure to verify the backup without affecting the original VM.

#### 6. Perform Failover (Restore)

- **What to Do:** In case of a disaster, use ASR to bring your VMs up in Azure.
- **Why:** This helps you quickly recover your applications and data, minimizing downtime.
- **How:**
  - Navigate to the **Recovery Services Vault** and select the VM.
  - Click **"Failover"** and choose the recovery point you want to restore from.
  - Confirm and start the failover process. Azure will recreate the VM in the target region.

#### 7. Perform Failback

- **What to Do:** After the disaster is resolved, move your VMs back to the original on-premises environment.
- **Why:** This restores normal operations and ensures your backups in Azure are updated.
- **How:**
  - Once your on-premises environment is ready, click **"Failback"** in the **Recovery Services Vault**.
  - Select the VMs to fail back and initiate the process.
  - Azure will replicate any changes made during the failover back to your on-premises VMs.

## Demo 2. Configure ASR for Azure VMs

### Overview

Think of **Azure Site Recovery (ASR)** as a way to keep your toys (data) safe by copying them to another room (another Azure region). This way, if something happens to the first room, you still have your toys in the second room.

### Steps to Configure ASR

#### 1. Create a Recovery Services Vault

- **What to Do:** Set up a secure storage area in Azure where all your backup data will be kept.
- **Why:** This vault acts as the central hub for managing your backups and recovery processes.
- **How:**
  - Log in to the [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com/).
  - Click on **"Create a resource"**.
  - Search for **"Recovery Services Vault"** and select it.
  - Click **"Create"** and fill in the required details like **Name**, **Resource Group**, and **Location**.
  - Click **"Review + create"** and then **"Create"**.

#### 2. Enable Replication for Azure VMs

- **What to Do:** Select the Azure VMs you want to protect and configure their replication settings to another Azure region.
- **Why:** Protecting VMs across different regions enhances availability and disaster recovery capabilities.
- **How:**
  - In the **Recovery Services Vault**, navigate to **"Site Recovery"**.
  - Click **"Replicate Application"**.
  - Choose **"Azure"** as both the source and target environments.
  - Select the VMs you want to replicate.
  - Define the replication policy, including the frequency of backups and retention periods.

#### 3. Configure Replication Policies

- **What to Do:** Define how your Azure VMs should be replicated, including frequency and retention policies.
- **Why:** Proper settings ensure that your data is backed up regularly and retained for as long as needed.
- **How:**
  - In the **Recovery Services Vault**, go to **"Backup Policies"**.
  - Create a new policy or modify an existing one to set the backup frequency (e.g., every hour) and retention period (e.g., keep backups for 30 days).

#### 4. Start Replicating VMs to the Recovery Region

- **What to Do:** Begin the process of copying your Azure VMs to the designated recovery region.
- **Why:** This ensures that there are current copies of your VMs in the recovery region, ready for recovery if needed.
- **How:**
  - After configuring replication settings, click **"Replicate"** to start the replication process.
  - Monitor the replication progress in the **"Replication Jobs"** section of the vault.

#### 5. Test the Failover

- **What to Do:** Perform a test failover to ensure that your VMs can be successfully recovered in the recovery region.
- **Why:** Testing ensures that your disaster recovery plan works as expected and identifies any issues before a real disaster occurs.
- **How:**
  - In the **Recovery Services Vault**, select the VM you want to test.
  - Click **"Test Failover"** and choose a recovery point.
  - Azure will create a temporary VM in the recovery region to verify the backup without affecting the original VM.

#### 6. Perform Failover (Restore)

- **What to Do:** In case of a disaster, initiate a failover to bring up your VMs in the recovery region using the replicated data.
- **Why:** This allows you to quickly recover your applications and data in the recovery region, minimizing downtime.
- **How:**
  - Navigate to the **Recovery Services Vault** and select the VM.
  - Click **"Failover"** and choose the recovery point you want to restore from.
  - Confirm and start the failover process. Azure will recreate the VM in the recovery region.

#### 7. Perform Failback

- **What to Do:** After resolving the disaster, reverse the failover process to restore your VMs back to the primary Azure region.
- **Why:** Ensures that your systems are back to normal operation after recovery.
- **How:**
  - Once your primary region is ready, click **"Failback"** in the **Recovery Services Vault**.
  - Select the VMs to fail back and initiate the process.
  - Azure will replicate any changes made during the failover back to your primary VMs.

## Summary

**Azure Site Recovery (ASR)** is like having a backup plan to keep your important data safe by copying it to another location. Whether you're protecting your on-premises machines or Azure VMs, ASR ensures that your data is always available, even if something goes wrong.

- **Demo 1:** Showed how to set up ASR for on-premises VMs, ensuring your local data is safe in Azure.
- **Demo 2:** Demonstrated configuring ASR for Azure VMs, protecting your data across different Azure regions.
