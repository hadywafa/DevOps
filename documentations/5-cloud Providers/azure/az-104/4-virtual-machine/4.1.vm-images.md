## Types of Azure VM Images

Azure offers various types of VM images to cater to different deployment needs. Understanding these types helps in selecting the right image for your scenarios.

### Marketplace Images

- **Description:** Pre-built images provided by Microsoft and third-party vendors available in the Azure Marketplace.
- **Examples:** Windows Server, Ubuntu, SQL Server images.
- **Use Case:** Quick deployment of standard operating systems and applications without customization.

### Managed Images

- **Description:** Stored in Azure as a managed resource, making it easy to replicate across multiple regions.
- **Features:**
  - Simplifies image management by handling storage and replication.
  - Supports versioning for better lifecycle management.
- **Use Case:** Deploy consistent VM configurations across different regions and subscriptions with ease.

### Custom Images

- **Description:** Created by users based on a configured VM and captured for reuse.
- **Features:**
  - Tailored to meet specific organizational requirements.
  - Can include custom software, configurations, and settings.
- **Use Case:** Deploy VMs with proprietary software or specialized settings not available in Marketplace images.

### Specialized Images

- **Description:** Capture the entire VM state, including all OS configurations, applications, and data.
- **Features:**
  - Includes system disks, data disks, and all configurations.
  - Ideal for creating exact replicas of a VM.
- **Use Case:** Disaster recovery, cloning environments, or migrating VMs.

## Azure Image Gallery

- **Description:** A centralized repository for managing and sharing VM images across multiple subscriptions and regions.
- **Features:**
  - **Versioning:** Maintain multiple versions of an image for better lifecycle management.
  - **Replication:** Geo-replicate images to multiple regions to enhance availability and performance.
  - **Image Sharing:** Share images with different teams or departments within your organization.
  - **Regional Availability:** Distribute images to various regions to reduce deployment times and latency.
- **Use Case:** Large organizations requiring consistent image deployment across diverse environments, ensuring high availability and scalability.

## Creating Custom Images

Creating a custom VM image (Capturing the VM as an image) involves preparing a VM with the desired configurations, generalizing it, and capturing the image for future deployments. Below are the step-by-step instructions to create a custom image using the Azure Portal, Azure PowerShell, and Azure CLI.

### 1. Prepare the Source VM

Before capturing the VM as an image, you need to prepare it by removing machine-specific information.

**For Windows VMs:**

- **Run Sysprep:**

  1. Connect to the VM via Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP).
  2. Open Command Prompt as an administrator.
  3. Execute the following command:

     ```cmd
     sysprep /oobe /generalize /shutdown
     ```

  - **Flags:**
    - `/oobe`: Presents the Windows Welcome screen on next boot.
    - `/generalize`: Removes unique system information.
    - `/shutdown`: Powers off the VM after preparation.

**For Linux VMs:**

- **Deprovision the VM:**

  1. Connect to the VM via SSH.
  2. Run the following command:

     ```bash
     sudo waagent -deprovision+user -force
     ```

  - **Note:** This command removes SSH host keys and user accounts, preparing the VM for image capture.

### 2. Generalize the VM

After running Sysprep or waagent, the VM is ready to be generalized and captured.

### 3. Capture the VM Image

You can capture the VM image using the Azure Portal, Azure PowerShell, or Azure CLI.

**Using Azure Portal:**

1. **Navigate to the VM:**

   - Go to the [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com/).
   - Select **"Virtual Machines"** from the left-hand menu.
   - Click on the VM you want to capture.

2. **Capture the Image:**
   - In the VM's overview pane, click **"Capture"** under the **"Operations"** section.
   - **Image Name:** Provide a name for your custom image.
   - **Resource Group:** Choose an existing resource group or create a new one to store the image.
   - **Shared Image Gallery (Optional):** Select an image gallery to store the image for better management and sharing.
   - **Generalize:** Ensure this option is checked to indicate that the VM has been generalized (using Sysprep or waagent).
   - **Automatically delete the VM after creating the image:** Check this option if you want to delete the source VM post-capture.
   - Click **"Review + create"** and then **"Create"** to initiate the image capture process.

## Deploying VMs Using Custom Images

Once the custom image is created, you can deploy new VMs using this image to ensure consistency and efficiency.

**Using Azure Portal:**

1. **Navigate to Custom Images:**

   - In the Azure Portal, select **"Images"** under **"All Services"**.
   - Click on your custom image or navigate to the **Shared Image Gallery** if you used it.

2. **Create a VM from the Image:**
   - Click **"Create VM"**.
   - Follow the VM creation wizard, selecting your custom image as the source.
   - Configure additional settings as needed and complete the deployment.

## Important Notes for VM Images

Here are the final important notes to keep in mind when creating and managing VM images in Azure:

1. **Preparation Steps**:

   - **Windows VMs**: Run Sysprep to generalize the OS.
   - **Linux VMs**: Use `waagent` to deprovision the VM.
   - **Shutdown**: Always shut down the VM after preparation and before capturing the image.

2. **Post-Capture VM Usability**:

   - **Generalized State**: The original VM becomes unusable after capturing the image because it is left in a generalized or deprovisioned state.
   - **Backups**: Ensure you back up any important data before creating the image.

3. **Unique Identifiers**:

   - **SID Reset**: Capturing the image resets unique identifiers like SID (for Windows). New VMs deployed from the image will have unique identifiers.

4. **Storage and Costs**:

   - **Storage Account**: Managed images are stored in Azure Storage. Be mindful of storage costs.
   - **Retention**: Regularly review and delete outdated images to manage costs and storage usage.

5. **Testing**:

   - **Validation**: Test the image by deploying a VM from it to ensure it works as expected.

6. **Automation**:
   - **Scripting**: Use scripts or automation tools to streamline the image creation process, ensuring consistency and efficiency.

## Summary

1. **Types of VM Images:**

   - **Marketplace Images:** Ideal for quick deployments using standard configurations.
   - **Custom Images:** Provide tailored configurations for specific business requirements.
   - **Managed Images:** Offer centralized management and easy replication across regions and subscriptions.
   - **Specialized Images:** Capture complete VM states for exact replication and recovery.

2. **Creating Custom Images:**

   - **Preparation:** Generalize the source VM using Sysprep (Windows) or waagent (Linux).
   - **Capture Process:** Use Azure Portal, PowerShell, or Azure CLI to capture and store the custom image.
   - **Publishing (Optional):** Utilize Azure Shared Image Gallery for enhanced management and distribution.

3. **Azure Shared Image Gallery Advantages:**
   - **Scalability:** Easily manage and distribute images across multiple regions and subscriptions.
   - **Version Control:** Maintain multiple versions of images for better lifecycle management.
   - **Geo-Replication:** Enhance availability and reduce deployment latency by replicating images to different regions.
