# Azure VM OS Disk Snapshot

An OS Disk Snapshot is a point-in-time backup of an Azure Virtual Machine's (VM) operating system disk. It captures the entire disk state at the moment the snapshot is taken, allowing you to restore or create new VMs from that snapshot.

## Key Features

1. **Point-in-Time Backup**: Captures the exact state of the OS disk at the time of the snapshot, preserving the OS configuration and installed applications.
2. **Incremental Snapshots**: Azure supports incremental snapshots, which store only the changes made since the last snapshot, reducing storage costs.
3. **Managed Disk Compatibility**: Works seamlessly with managed disks, ensuring high availability and durability.

## Use Case

- **Disaster Recovery**: Quickly restore a VM to a previous state in case of system failure, data corruption, or other issues.
- **Testing and Development**: Create isolated environments for testing or development by spinning up new VMs from snapshots.
- **Migration and Cloning**: Use snapshots to clone VMs or migrate workloads to different regions or subscriptions.

## Types of Snapshots

1. **Full Snapshot**

   - **Description**: Captures the entire disk at a specific point in time.
   - **Use Case**: Ideal for initial backups or when you need a complete copy of the disk.
   - **Cost**: Typically higher cost because it includes all the data on the disk.

2. **Incremental Snapshot**
   - **Description**: Captures only the changes made to the disk since the last snapshot. Each incremental snapshot contains the differences from the previous snapshot.
   - **Use Case**: Useful for ongoing backups where you want to capture changes over time. Efficient for reducing storage costs and backup times.
   - **Cost**: Lower cost because it only stores the changed data.

## Best Practices

- **Frequency**: Schedule snapshots based on your data change rate and recovery needs. For critical applications, more frequent snapshots may be necessary.
- **Retention Policy**: Define how long you will retain snapshots to manage storage costs. Regularly delete older snapshots that are no longer needed.
- **Automation**: Use Azure Automation or scripts to automate snapshot creation and deletion, ensuring consistent backup practices.

## Important Considerations

- **Storage Costs**: Snapshots incur storage costs, so manage and delete unnecessary snapshots to optimize costs.
- **Snapshot Limitations**: Ensure that snapshots are used for point-in-time recovery and not as a primary backup solution.
- **Permissions**: You need the appropriate permissions (such as "Microsoft.Compute/snapshots/write") to create and manage snapshots.

Azure offers different types of snapshots to suit various needs. Here's an overview of the types of snapshots, their differences, and when to use each:
