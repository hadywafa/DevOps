# Managed Image vs Custom Image

## **1. Managed Image**

A **managed image** is a standalone image resource in Azure that can be used to create multiple VMs. It does not include versioning or replication across regions. Managed images are stored as Azure resources in your specified resource group and region.

### Use Case

- For straightforward deployments in a single region.
- When you don't need versioning or cross-region replication.

### Key Fields

1. **Subscription**:
   - The Azure subscription under which the managed image is created.
2. **Resource Group**:
   - The resource group to which the managed image belongs. Managed images are scoped to the selected region of this group.
3. **Region**:
   - Specifies the Azure region where the managed image will be stored and accessible.
4. **Share image to Azure Compute Gallery**:
   - **No** is selected for a managed image. This means the image will not be part of a gallery and won't support versioning or replication.
5. **Automatically delete this virtual machine after creating the image**:
   - If checked, the VM will be deleted after capturing the managed image. Ensure you have no further use for the VM.
6. **Name**:
   - The name of the managed image resource.

## **2.Custom Image**

A **custom image** is part of the Azure Compute Gallery. It supports **versioning**, **regional replication**, and **shallow replication** for distributed deployments.

### Use Case

- For deployments requiring version control, sharing across subscriptions, or replication to multiple regions.
- When you want to keep a history of image updates.

### Key Fields

1. **Target Azure Compute Gallery**:
   - Select an existing gallery or create a new one. The gallery organizes and stores custom images.
2. **Operating System State**:
   - **Generalized**:
     - The image is prepared for deployment and needs customization (hostname, admin credentials) during deployment.
   - **Specialized**:
     - The image includes specific configurations (e.g., hostname, credentials) and is ready for direct deployment without additional setup.
3. **Target VM Image Definition**:
   - Defines the metadata for the image (e.g., OS type, SKU, publisher).
4. **Version Number**:
   - Assign a version (e.g., 1.0.0) to the image. This helps maintain multiple versions of the same image for different purposes.
5. **Exclude from Latest**:
   - If checked, the version will not be marked as "latest" and won't be used by default when deploying VMs from the gallery.
6. **End of Life Date**:
   - Specify an expiration date for the image version.
7. **Replication**:
   - Set up replication to different Azure regions for high availability. Options include:
     - **Shallow Replication**:
       - Stores metadata only in other regions until explicitly accessed, saving storage costs.
     - **Target Regions**:
       - Define where the image will be replicated, the number of replicas, and the storage SKU.

## **Differences Between Managed Images and Custom Images**

| Feature                  | Managed Image                | Custom Image (Azure Compute Gallery) |
| ------------------------ | ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| **Versioning**           | No                           | Yes                                  |
| **Regional Replication** | No                           | Yes                                  |
| **Usage Scope**          | Limited to one region        | Globally available (if replicated)   |
| **Storage**              | Azure-managed storage        | Gallery-managed storage              |
| **Best For**             | Simple use cases, one region | Multi-region deployments, versioning |

## Creation Steps

### **Steps to Create a Managed Image**

1. **Prepare the Source VM**:

   - Create and configure a Virtual Machine (VM) with the necessary OS, applications, and settings.
   - Generalize the VM:

     - **Windows**: Run `sysprep.exe` with the "Generalize" option.
     - **Linux**: Run the command:

       ```bash
       sudo waagent -deprovision+user
       ```

2. **Deallocate the VM**:

   - Stop the VM from the Azure portal to ensure it is in a suitable state for image capture.

3. **Capture the Image**:

   - Navigate to the VM in the **Azure portal**.
   - Click **Capture** in the top menu.
   - Fill in the fields:
     - **Resource Group**: Choose the resource group for storing the managed image.
     - **Region**: Select the region where the managed image will reside.
     - **Name**: Provide a name for the managed image.
     - **Share image to Azure Compute Gallery**: Select **No**.
     - **Automatically delete this VM**: Check this box if you no longer need the VM.
   - Click **Review + Create**, then **Create**.

4. **Verify the Managed Image**:

   - Go to the **Images** section in the Azure portal.
   - Verify that your image is listed and ready for deployment.

5. **Deploy a VM from the Managed Image**:
   - When creating a new VM, select **"Create VM from image"** and choose the managed image as the source.

### **Steps to Create a Custom Image Using Azure Compute Gallery**

1. **Prepare the Source VM**:

   - Create and configure the VM with all necessary applications and settings.
   - Generalize the VM:

     - **Windows**: Run `sysprep.exe` with the "Generalize" option.
     - **Linux**: Run:

       ```bash
       sudo waagent -deprovision+user
       ```

2. **Deallocate the VM**:

   - Stop the VM to ensure it is ready for image capture.

3. **Create an Azure Compute Gallery**:

   - In the Azure portal, search for **"Azure Compute Gallery"**.
   - Click **Create** to set up a new gallery.
     - Fill in the gallery name, region, and resource group.
     - Click **Review + Create**, then **Create**.

4. **Capture the Image**:

   - Navigate to the source VM.
   - Click **Capture** in the top menu.
   - Fill in the following fields:
     - **Target Azure Compute Gallery**: Select an existing gallery or create a new one.
     - **Operating System State**: Choose **Generalized** (for standard customization) or **Specialized** (for pre-configured deployment).
     - **Target VM Image Definition**: Create a new definition specifying the OS type, SKU, and publisher.
     - **Version Number**: Specify a version number (e.g., 1.0.0).
     - **Replication Settings**: Add target regions for replication and configure storage SKU and replica counts.
   - Click **Review + Create**, then **Create**.

5. **Verify the Custom Image**:

   - Go to the **Azure Compute Gallery**.
   - Verify the image definition and version are listed.

6. **Deploy a VM from the Custom Image**:
   - Go to **Azure Compute Gallery**.
   - Select the image version and click **Create VM**.
