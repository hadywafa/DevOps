# VM Storage

## Disk Types

### OS Disk

- OS preinstalled to disk (you cannot perform the install manually).
- OS Disks Can use marketplace image, uploaded VHDs, or custom images.
- OS Disks can be resized, but this requires downtime (stop/deallocate VM).
- OS disks cannot be added/detached, but they can be swapped.

### Data Disk

- Data Used for persistent data storage (application data, files, etc).
- Data Disks can be resized without downtime (for some VM SKUs).
- You can add/detach data disks without downtime (but you should stop activity).

### Temp Disk

- Temporary fast storage, that is provided from the underlying Azure hypervisor.
- Mounted by default for both Windows (D drive) and Linux (/dev/sdbl).
- Considered ephemeral (data does not persist) and can be lost on restart.
- Not all VM's come with a temp disk; size/availability based on VM SKU.
