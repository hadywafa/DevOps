1. **Custom Script Extension**
2. **Automation State Configuration**
3. **Cloud-Init**

## **1. What are VM Custom Images?**

**VM Custom Images** are personalized templates that capture a VMâ€™s operating system, applications, and settings. They allow you to create new VMs with the same configuration, ensuring consistency and saving time.

- **Use Case:** Quickly deploy multiple VMs with identical setups without manual configuration each time.
- **Benefits:** Consistency, speed, and reduced manual effort in VM provisioning.

## **2. Custom Script Extension**

### **What is Custom Script Extension?**

The **Custom Script Extension** allows you to run scripts on your VM after it has been deployed. These scripts can install software, configure settings, or perform any custom tasks you need.

### **Key Points**

- **Flexibility:** Execute PowerShell (Windows) or Bash (Linux) scripts.
- **Timing:** Run scripts during or after VM deployment.
- **Use Cases:** Installing applications, setting up configurations, automating tasks.

### **Example Scenario**

After deploying a VM, use a Custom Script Extension to install and configure a web server automatically.

## **3. Automation State Configuration**

### **What is Automation State Configuration?**

**Automation State Configuration** uses **Desired State Configuration (DSC)** to define and maintain the desired state of your VMs. It ensures that your VMs remain consistent by automatically correcting any drift from the defined configuration.

### **Key Points**

- **Consistency:** Keeps VM configurations aligned with predefined settings.
- **Automation:** Automatically applies and enforces configurations.
- **Use Cases:** Ensuring security settings, maintaining software versions, enforcing policies.

### **Example Scenario**

Ensure that all VMs have the latest security patches and specific services running at all times.

## **4. Cloud-Init**

### **What is Cloud-Init?**

**Cloud-Init** is a tool used mainly with Linux VMs to automate the initial setup during the first boot. It allows you to define configurations such as user accounts, SSH keys, package installations, and more.

### **Key Points**

- **Initialization:** Runs during the VMâ€™s first boot to set up configurations.
- **Customization:** Define settings using YAML or shell scripts.
- **Use Cases:** Automating VM setup, configuring network settings, installing software.

### **Example Scenario**

Automatically create a user account and install necessary software packages when a Linux VM is first launched.
