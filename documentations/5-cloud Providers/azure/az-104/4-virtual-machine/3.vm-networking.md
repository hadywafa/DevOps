## **Key Networking Components of an Azure VM**

### **1. VM SKU**

- **Definition**: Specifies the type and size of a VM, determining its hardware specifications, including CPU, memory, storage, and network capabilities.
- **Impact on Networking**: Influences network bandwidth, the number of supported network interfaces (NICs), and overall network performance.

### **2. Network Interface (NIC)**

- **Definition**: A virtual network interface card attached to a VM.
- **Purpose**: Connects the VM to a Virtual Network (VNet), enabling it to communicate with other resources within the VNet and beyond.
- **Key Features**: Each NIC can have one or more IP configurations, allowing for multiple IP addresses per NIC.

### **3. IP Configurations**

- **Definition**: Specifies the IP address settings for a NIC, including private and public IP addresses.
- **Components**:
  - **Private IP Address**: Assigned within the VNet, enabling internal communication.
  - **Public IP Address**: Allows external access to the VM from the internet.
  - **DNS Settings**: Configures the DNS name label and settings for the IP address.

## **VM Networking Notes**

- You can change IP addresses, and subnets associated with a network interface.
- Changing virtual network is not possible. For this, a virtual machine must be recreated.
- IPv6 addresses are supported, but must firstly be enabled for the corresponding vnet/subnet.
