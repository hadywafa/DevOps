- **Features:**
  - **Versioning:** Maintain multiple versions of an image for better lifecycle management.
  - **Replication:** Geo-replicate images to multiple regions to enhance availability and performance.
  - **Image Sharing:** Share images with different teams or departments within your organization.
  - **Regional Availability:** Distribute images to various regions to reduce deployment times and latency.
- **Use Case:** Large organizations requiring consistent image deployment across diverse environments, ensuring high availability and scalability.

## Creating a Custom VM Image in Azure

Creating a custom VM image involves preparing a VM with the desired configurations, generalizing it, and capturing the image for future deployments. Below are the step-by-step instructions to create a custom image using the Azure Portal, Azure PowerShell, and Azure CLI.

### 1. Prepare the Source VM

Before capturing the VM as an image, you need to prepare it by removing machine-specific information.

**For Windows VMs:**

- **Run Sysprep:**

  1. Connect to the VM via Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP).
  2. Open Command Prompt as an administrator.
  3. Execute the following command:

     ```cmd
     sysprep /oobe /generalize /shutdown
     ```

  - **Flags:**
    - `/oobe`: Presents the Windows Welcome screen on next boot.
    - `/generalize`: Removes unique system information.
    - `/shutdown`: Powers off the VM after preparation.

**For Linux VMs:**

- **Deprovision the VM:**

  1. Connect to the VM via SSH.
  2. Run the following command:

     ```bash
     sudo waagent -deprovision+user -force
     ```

  - **Note:** This command removes SSH host keys and user accounts, preparing the VM for image capture.

### 2. Generalize the VM

After running Sysprep or waagent, the VM is ready to be generalized and captured.

### 3. Capture the VM Image

You can capture the VM image using the Azure Portal, Azure PowerShell, or Azure CLI.

##### Using Azure Portal

1. **Navigate to the VM:**

   - Go to the [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com/).
   - Select **"Virtual Machines"** from the left-hand menu.
   - Click on the VM you want to capture.

2. **Capture the Image:**
   - In the VM's overview pane, click **"Capture"** under the **"Operations"** section.
   - **Image Name:** Provide a name for your custom image.
   - **Resource Group:** Choose an existing resource group or create a new one to store the image.
   - **Shared Image Gallery (Optional):** Select an image gallery to store the image for better management and sharing.
   - **Generalize:** Ensure this option is checked to indicate that the VM has been generalized (using Sysprep or waagent).
   - **Automatically delete the VM after creating the image:** Check this option if you want to delete the source VM post-capture.
   - Click **"Review + create"** and then **"Create"** to initiate the image capture process.

## Deploying VMs Using Custom Images

Once the custom image is created, you can deploy new VMs using this image to ensure consistency and efficiency.

### Using Azure Portal

1. **Navigate to Custom Images:**

   - In the Azure Portal, select **"Images"** under **"All Services"**.
   - Click on your custom image or navigate to the **Shared Image Gallery** if you used it.

2. **Create a VM from the Image:**
   - Click **"Create VM"**.
   - Follow the VM creation wizard, selecting your custom image as the source.
   - Configure additional settings as needed and complete the deployment.

## Best Practices

1. **Adopt the Principle of Least Privilege:**

   - Assign only the necessary permissions required for users and applications to minimize security risks.
   - Limit access to image galleries and custom images to authorized personnel.

2. **Use Descriptive Naming Conventions:**

   - Name your images and galleries clearly to reflect their purpose and configurations (e.g., `WebServerImage_V1`, `DatabaseGallery`).

3. **Regularly Update Custom Images:**

   - Incorporate the latest updates, patches, and configurations to ensure security and performance.
   - Maintain versioning to track changes and enable rollback if necessary.

4. **Leverage Shared Image Gallery for Scalability:**

   - Utilize the Azure Shared Image Gallery to manage and distribute images across multiple regions and subscriptions efficiently.
   - Use geo-replication to enhance availability and reduce deployment latency.

5. **Automate Image Creation and Deployment:**

   - Use Azure PowerShell, Azure CLI, or ARM templates to automate the creation and deployment of custom images, ensuring consistency and reducing manual errors.

6. **Implement Backup and Recovery Plans:**

   - Regularly back up your image galleries and custom images to prevent data loss.
   - Use Azure Backup services to secure your image repositories.

7. **Monitor and Audit Image Usage:**

   - Use Azure Monitor and Azure Activity Logs to track image deployments and access patterns.
   - Conduct regular audits to ensure compliance and detect unauthorized access.

8. **Optimize Storage Costs:**
   - Choose appropriate storage account types for your image galleries based on performance and cost requirements.
   - Delete outdated or unused image versions to free up storage space.
