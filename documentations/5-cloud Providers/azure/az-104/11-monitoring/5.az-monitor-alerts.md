Setting up Azure Monitor Alerts is like setting up a home security system. You install sensors (alert rules) on doors and windows, connect them to an alarm system (action groups), and get notified immediately if something goes wrong. Here's a simple way to understand how it works:

1. **Define Alert Rules:** Decide what events or metrics you want to monitor.
2. **Create Action Groups:** Set up how you want to be notified and what actions to take.
3. **Link Alert Rules to Action Groups:** Connect your monitoring conditions to your notification preferences.
4. **Monitor and Respond:** Receive alerts and take necessary actions to resolve issues.

## Demo 1: Creating a Basic Alert for CPU Usage on an Azure VM
