## Key Components

### 1. Firewall

- **Not VMs, But Virtual Devices**: Azure Firewall itself isn't a VM. It's a managed service provided by Azure that acts as a virtual device.
- **Traffic Control**: When you set up Azure Firewall, it sits in a special subnet (`AzureFirewallSubnet`). It watches the traffic going in and out of your VNet and applies rules you set up to control this traffic.

### 2. Networking

- **VNet to VNet Filtering/Routing**: Imagine you have different sections (VNets) of a large building. Azure Firewall can control which sections can talk to each other.
- **Route Table**: Think of a route table as a map that tells the traffic where to go. You configure this map to direct the traffic through the firewall first, so the firewall can check and control it.

### 3. Firewall Policy

- **Global Management**: You can create firewall policies that act like a set of rules. These policies can be applied across multiple firewalls, not just one VNet. It's like having a central rulebook that can be used everywhere.
- **Hierarchy**: Policies can be organized in a tree-like structure. Think of it like folders and subfolders on your computer. You can have a main policy and then more specific sub-policies that apply additional rules.

### Summary

- **Azure Firewall**: Acts like a virtual security guard, not a VM.
- **Traffic Control**: Controlled by placing the firewall in a special subnet and using route tables to direct traffic through it.
- **Management**: Managed globally using firewall policies.
- **Policy Hierarchy**: Organized like a rulebook with main rules and specific sub-rules for different situations.

## Azure Firewall vs. Traditional On-Premises Firewalls

**Similarities:**

- **Functionality:** Both Azure Firewall and traditional on-premises firewalls perform essential network security functions such as traffic filtering, threat protection, and access control.
- **Rule Management:** They use similar rule-based approaches to allow or deny traffic based on defined policies.
- **Logging and Monitoring:** Both provide logging and monitoring capabilities to track and analyze network traffic and security events.

**Differences:**

- **Deployment and Maintenance:**

  - **Traditional Firewalls:** Require physical hardware, manual updates, and maintenance.
  - **Azure Firewall:** Is a cloud-native service that is automatically maintained, updated, and scaled by Azure, eliminating the need for physical hardware management.

- **Scalability:**

  - **Traditional Firewalls:** Limited by the capacity of physical devices; scaling often requires additional hardware purchases and configurations.
  - **Azure Firewall:** Automatically scales to handle varying traffic loads without manual intervention, leveraging Azure's cloud infrastructure.

- **Integration and Automation:**

  - **Traditional Firewalls:** Integration with cloud services and automation requires additional tools and configurations.
  - **Azure Firewall:** Seamlessly integrates with other Azure services and supports automation through Azure APIs, PowerShell, and Azure CLI.

- **Cost Structure:**
  - **Traditional Firewalls:** Involves upfront capital expenditures for hardware and ongoing costs for maintenance.
  - **Azure Firewall:** Operates on a pay-as-you-go model, allowing for cost flexibility based on usage.

## Azure Firewall vs. Network Security Groups (NSGs)

While both **Azure Firewall** and **Network Security Groups (NSGs)** are used to control network traffic in Azure, they serve different purposes and offer varying levels of functionality.

### **Azure Firewall**

- **Scope:** Global within a Virtual Network or across multiple VNets using firewall policies.
- **Functionality:**

  - **Stateful Inspection:** Maintains context about active connections.
  - **Application Rules:** Filter traffic based on fully qualified domain names (FQDNs).
  - **Network Rules:** Control traffic based on IP addresses, ports, and protocols.
  - **Threat Intelligence:** Blocks traffic from known malicious sources.
  - **Centralized Management:** Manage policies across multiple VNets.

- **Use Case:** Comprehensive security for entire VNets, protecting against a wide range of threats and providing detailed traffic analysis.

### **Network Security Groups (NSGs)**

- **Scope:** Local to individual subnets or network interfaces within a Virtual Network.
- **Functionality:**

  - **Stateless Filtering:** Evaluates each packet independently without maintaining connection state.
  - **Inbound and Outbound Rules:** Allow or deny traffic based on source/destination IPs, ports, and protocols.
  - **No Application Layer Filtering:** Cannot filter traffic based on application-level attributes like FQDNs.

- **Use Case:** Basic traffic filtering for specific subnets or VMs, enforcing granular access controls at the network interface or subnet level.

## Step-by-Step Guide to Configure Azure Firewall in Hub-and-Spoke Network

### Assumptions

- **Hub VNet**: `Hub-VNet`
- **Spoke VNets**: `Spoke1-VNet` and `Spoke2-VNet`
- **Peering**: `Hub-VNet` is already peered with `Spoke1-VNet` and `Spoke2-VNet`

### Step 1: Create Azure Firewall in Hub-VNet

1. **Create a Subnet for Azure Firewall**:

   - In `Hub-VNet`, create a subnet named `AzureFirewallSubnet`.
   - Example address range: `10.0.1.0/26`.

2. **Create Azure Firewall**:
   - Go to the Azure portal, select **Create a resource**, search for **Firewall**, and click **Create**.
   - Enter a name (e.g., `Hub-FW`), select your resource group, and choose the region.
   - **Public IP**: Create a new Standard SKU public IP address for the firewall.
   - **Virtual Network**: Select `Hub-VNet` and the `AzureFirewallSubnet`.
   - **Review + Create**: Review the settings and click **Create**.

### Step 2: Configure Firewall Policy

#### Create Parent Firewall Policy

1. **Create Parent Firewall Policy**:

   - Go to the Azure portal, select **Firewall policies**, and click **Create**.
   - Enter a name (e.g., `Parent-FW-Policy`), select your resource group, and choose the region.
   - Define common rules (e.g., default deny inbound and outbound traffic) that apply to all firewalls.
   - Click **Review + Create**.

2. **Associate Parent Policy with Firewall**:
   - Navigate to your Azure Firewall instance (`Hub-FW`).
   - In the settings, select **Firewall Policy** and associate the `Parent-FW-Policy`.

#### Create Child Firewall Policy

1. **Create Child Firewall Policy**:

   - Go to the Azure portal, select **Firewall policies**, and click **Create**.
   - Enter a name (e.g., `Child-FW-Policy`), select your resource group, and choose the region.
   - Set `Parent-FW-Policy` as the parent policy.
   - Define specific rules (e.g., allow traffic between spokes) that apply to the child policy.
   - Click **Review + Create**.

2. **Associate Child Policy with Firewall**:
   - Navigate to your Azure Firewall instance (`Hub-FW`).
   - In the settings, select **Firewall Policy** and associate the `Child-FW-Policy`.

### Step 3: Configure Route Tables

1. **Create Route Table for Spokes**:

   - Go to the Azure portal, select **Route tables**, and click **Create**.
   - Enter a name (e.g., `Spoke-RT`), select your resource group, and choose the region.

2. **Add Routes**:

   - **Default Route**:
     - Address Prefix: `0.0.0.0/0`
     - Next Hop Type: **Virtual appliance**
     - Next Hop Address: IP address of the Azure Firewall in `Hub-VNet`.

3. **Associate Route Table**:
   - Associate the `Spoke-RT` with the subnets in both `Spoke1-VNet` and `Spoke2-VNet`.

### Step 4: Test the Configuration

1. **Deploy Test VMs**:

   - Create a virtual machine in each of the VNets: `Hub-VNet`, `Spoke1-VNet`, and `Spoke2-VNet`.

2. **Test Connectivity**:
   - Ensure that the VMs can communicate with each other through the Azure Firewall and the rules defined in the firewall policies are enforced correctly.

## Summary

**Azure Firewall** is a robust, cloud-native network security service that offers comprehensive protection for your Azure Virtual Networks. It mirrors many functionalities of traditional on-premises firewalls while providing the scalability, flexibility, and ease of management inherent to cloud services.

- **Similarity to Traditional Firewalls:** Like traditional firewalls, Azure Firewall controls incoming and outgoing network traffic based on security rules, offering stateful packet inspection, threat intelligence, and centralized policy management.

- **Differences from NSGs:**
  - **Azure Firewall** provides advanced features like application-level filtering, threat intelligence integration, and centralized management across multiple VNets.
  - **Network Security Groups (NSGs)** offer basic traffic filtering at the subnet or network interface level, operating at a lower layer without application-specific rules or threat intelligence.
