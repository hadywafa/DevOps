## Service Endpoints

- **With Service Endpoints**, your traffic from the VNet travels over the Azure backbone network to the public endpoint of the Azure service. Even though the endpoint is public, the connection is secure and private within Azure's infrastructure.
- **Example**: If you enable a service endpoint for Azure Storage, your traffic from the VNet to the storage account uses the Azure backbone network but reaches the public IP of the storage service. The storage service is configured to accept traffic only from your VNet, ensuring secure communication.

## Private Endpoints

- **With Private Endpoints**, you create a private IP within your VNet that acts as a private endpoint for the Azure service. Traffic to the Azure service from your VNet stays entirely within the private IP space, never using public IPs.
- **Example**: If you set up a private endpoint for Azure Storage, a private IP address is assigned to the storage account within your VNet. All traffic between your VNet and the storage account uses this private IP, ensuring that it never goes out to the public internet.

## Key Differences

| Feature                   | Service Endpoints                                    | Private Endpoints                                |
| ------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| **Connection Path**       | Azure backbone network to public service endpoint    | Private IP within VNet to Azure service          |
| **Public IP Requirement** | Yes, public endpoint of the Azure service is used    | No, uses private IP assigned within your VNet    |
| **Traffic**               | Traffic remains on Azure backbone, reaches public IP | Traffic remains entirely within private IP space |
| **Use Case**              | Easier setup for secure, optimized connections       | Enhanced security with full private connectivity |

## Summary

- **Service Endpoints**: Traffic goes over the Azure backbone to the public endpoint of the Azure service. The connection is secure but uses a public IP of the azure services.
- **Private Endpoints**: Traffic stays entirely within the private network using private IPs, offering enhanced security with no exposure to public IPs.

Both options provide secure connectivity, but the choice depends on your specific security and network requirements.
