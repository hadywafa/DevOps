## Key Components

Azure Resource Manager consists of several key components that work together to provide comprehensive resource management:

### 1. **Resource Groups**

- **What They Are:** Containers that hold related Azure resources.
- **Function:** Allow you to manage, monitor, and organize resources collectively based on lifecycle, permissions, and policies.

### 2. **Resources**

- **What They Are:** Individual services or components deployed within Azure, such as virtual machines, storage accounts, and databases.
- **Function:** Represent the actual services and infrastructure that make up your Azure environment.

### 3. **Resource Providers**

- **What They Are:** Services that offer specific types of resources (e.g., Microsoft.Compute for virtual machines).
- **Function:** Facilitate the creation, management, and configuration of resources by providing the necessary APIs and services.

### 4. **Templates**

_Note: Although the focus is not on templates, it's important to understand their relationship with ARM._

- **What They Are:** JSON files that define the infrastructure and configuration for your Azure resources.
- **Function:** Enable declarative deployments by specifying the desired state of resources, which ARM then implements.

### 5. **Locks**

- **What They Are:** Mechanisms to prevent accidental deletion or modification of resources.
- **Function:** Protect critical resources by applying read-only or delete locks.

## How Azure Resource Manager Works

Azure Resource Manager operates as a management layer that interacts with Azure's underlying services to deploy, manage, and monitor resources. Here's a simplified overview of how ARM works:

1. **Define the Desired State:**

   - Specify the resources you need and their configurations using the Azure Portal, Azure CLI, Azure PowerShell, or REST APIs.

2. **Submit the Deployment:**

   - Send the deployment request to ARM, which processes the instructions.

3. **ARM Orchestrates the Deployment:**

   - ARM handles resource provisioning, ensuring dependencies are managed and resources are deployed in the correct order.

4. **Monitor and Manage:**

   - Use ARM's management tools to monitor the health, performance, and compliance of your resources.

5. **Update or Delete Resources:**
   - Modify or remove resources as needed, with ARM ensuring changes are applied consistently across the environment.

## Examples of Using Azure Resource Manager

### Example 1: Creating a Resource Group and Deploying Resources via Azure Portal

1. **Create a Resource Group:**

   - Log in to the [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com/).
   - Click on **"Resource groups"** in the left-hand menu.
   - Click **"Add"** and provide a **Name** (e.g., `MyResourceGroup`) and **Region** (e.g., `East US`).
   - Click **"Review + create"** and then **"Create"**.

2. **Deploy a Virtual Machine:**
   - Navigate to **"Virtual Machines"**.
   - Click **"Add"** and fill in the required details (e.g., VM name, image, size).
   - Select the **Resource Group** you created earlier (`MyResourceGroup`).
   - Configure networking and other settings as needed.
   - Click **"Review + create"** and then **"Create"**.

### Example 2: Managing Resources with Azure CLI

1. **Install Azure CLI:**

   - Download and install Azure CLI from [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/cli/azure/install-azure-cli).

2. **Log In to Azure:**

   ```bash
   az login
   ```

3. **Create a Resource Group:**

   ```bash
   az group create --name MyResourceGroup --location eastus
   ```

4. **Create a Storage Account:**

   ```bash
   az storage account create --name mystorageaccount --resource-group MyResourceGroup --location eastus --sku Standard_LRS
   ```

5. **List All Resource Groups:**

   ```bash
   az group list --output table
   ```
