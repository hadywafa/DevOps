# IAM in Azure

**Identity and Access Management (IAM)** is a cornerstone of Azure's security framework, ensuring that the right individuals have appropriate access to resources. In Azure, IAM is primarily managed through two systems:

1. **Azure Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**
2. **Azure Entra ID Roles** (formerly Azure Active Directory Roles)

## Azure Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

![alt text](images/azure-iam.png)

### What is Azure RBAC?

**Azure Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)** is a system that provides fine-grained access management for Azure resources.  
It allows you to assign `Role Definition` to `Security principals` at specific `Scopes`.

- **Purpose:** Control who can perform what actions on Azure resources.
- **Security principals**
  - **user**
  - **security group**
  - **app registration**
  - **managed identity**
- **Role Definition**
  - **Built-in Roles**
  - **Custom Role**
- **Scope Levels:**
  - **Management Group**
  - **Subscription**
  - **Resource Group**
  - **Resource**

### Types of Azure RBAC Roles

Azure RBAC includes three primary types of roles:

1. **Built-in Roles:**

   - **Description:** Predefined roles provided by Azure.
   - **Examples:**
     - **Owner:** Full access to all resources, including the ability to delegate access.
     - **Contributor:** Can create and manage all types of Azure resources but cannot grant access to others.
     - **Reader:** Can view existing Azure resources.

2. **Custom Roles:**

   - **Description:** User-defined roles tailored to specific organizational needs.
   - **Features:**
     - Define precise permissions by selecting actions.
     - Suitable for unique scenarios not covered by built-in roles.

### How Azure RBAC Works

Azure RBAC operates by assigning roles to security principals at a particular scope.
The role definition outlines the permissions, specifying which actions are allowed or denied.

- **Security Principal:** An identity requesting access (`user`, `security group`, `app`, `managed`).
- **Role Definition:** A collection of permissions (`built-in` or `custom` roles).
- **Assignment:** Binding a role definition to a security principal at a specific scope.

**Example Workflow:**

1. **Define Scope:** Choose the subscription or resource group.
2. **Select Role:** Choose a built-in role like Contributor.
3. **Assign Role:** Assign the Contributor role to a user for the chosen scope.

### Custom Azure RBAC Roles

**Custom RBAC Roles** allow you to create roles with specific permissions tailored to your organization's needs.

![alt text](images/azure-rbac-custom-role.png)

- **Actions:** Allowed control plane actions
- **NotActions:** Subtracted control plane actions
- **DataActions:** allowed data plane actions.
- **NotDataActions:** Subtracted data plane actions.
- **AssignableScopes:**
  - Root (`"/*"`)
  - ManagementGroups (`"/providers/Microsoft.Management/managementGroups/{ID}"`)
  - Subscriptions (`"/subscriptions/{ID}"`)
  - Resource Groups (`"/subscriptions/ID/resourceGroups/{name}"`)

#### **Example: Creating a Custom RBAC Role**

**Scenario:** A development team needs to manage virtual machines (VMs) but should not have permissions to manage networking resources.

**Steps:**

1. **Define the Role JSON:**

   ```json
   {
     "Name": "VM Manager",
     "Description": "Can manage virtual machines but cannot manage networking resources.",
     "Actions": [
       "Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachines/read",
       "Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachines/write",
       "Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachines/start/action",
       "Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachines/deallocate/action"
     ],
     "NotActions": ["Microsoft.Network/*"],
     "AssignableScopes": ["/subscriptions/{subscription-id}"]
   }
   ```

2. **Create the Custom Role Using Azure CLI:**

   ```bash
   az role definition create --role-definition vm-manager-role.json
   ```

3. **Assign the Custom Role to a User or Group:**

   ```bash
   az role assignment create --assignee user@example.com --role "VM Manager" --scope /subscriptions/{subscription-id}
   ```

### Use Cases for Azure RBAC

- **Resource Management:** Assign specific permissions to developers to manage only the resources they need.
- **Compliance:** Ensure that only authorized personnel can access sensitive resources.
- **Operational Efficiency:** Streamline access management by using groups and roles instead of individual assignments.

### Notes

- Azure RBAC Custom Roles are available without any special licensing requirements.
- Azure RBAC is not Azure Policy. RBAC is for permissions, Policy is for standards.

## Azure Entra ID Roles

**Azure Entra ID Roles** are a set of predefined and custom roles that control access to Azure Entra ID resources and functionalities. These roles determine what administrative actions users and groups can perform within the Entra ID environment.  
**Purpose:** Manage who can perform specific administrative tasks within Azure Entra ID, ensuring secure and organized identity management.

![alt text](images/entra-id-iam-1.png)
![alt text](images/entra-id-iam-2.png)

- **Security Principals**

  - **User:** Individual accounts that represent people.
  - **Security Group:** Collections of users grouped for easier management.
  - **Service Principal:** Applications or services that need access to Azure resources.
  - **Managed Identity:** Identities managed by Azure for services to access resources securely.

- **Role Definitions**

  - **Built-in Roles:** Predefined roles provided by Azure Entra ID.
  - **Custom Roles:** User-defined roles tailored to specific organizational needs.

- **Scope**
  - **tenant**
  - **administrative units (AU)**
  - **app**

### Types of Azure Entra ID Roles

Azure Entra ID includes various roles that control access to the Entra ID itself and its features:

1. **Built-in Roles:**

   - **Global Administrator:**
     - **Description:** Has access to all administrative features in Azure Entra ID and services that use Azure Entra ID identities.
     - **Capabilities:** Manage everything, including creating and managing roles.
   - **User Administrator:**
     - **Description:** Can manage users and groups, reset passwords, and monitor service health.
   - **Security Administrator:**
     - **Description:** Can manage security-related features like Conditional Access policies and security reports.
   - **Application Administrator:**
     - **Description:** Can manage application registrations and enterprise applications.

2. **Custom Roles:**
   - **Description:** User-defined roles to meet specific organizational needs.
   - **Features:**
     - Define precise permissions within Azure Entra ID.
     - Suitable for scenarios not covered by built-in roles.

### How Azure Entra ID Roles Work

Azure Entra ID roles are assigned to security principals (users, groups) to grant them administrative permissions within the Entra ID environment.

- **Role Definition:** Specifies the permissions and allowed actions.
- **Role Assignment:** Associates a role with a security principal at a specific scope (usually the entire Entra ID tenant).

**Example Workflow:**

1. **Select Role:** Choose the Global Administrator role.
2. **Assign Role:** Assign it to a user to grant them full administrative access to Entra ID.

### Custom Azure Entra ID Roles

**Custom Entra ID Roles** allow you to create roles that provide specific administrative permissions within Azure Entra ID.

#### **Example: Creating a Custom Entra ID Role**

**Scenario:** Your organization requires a role that allows users to manage only group memberships without granting access to other directory settings.

```json
{
  "displayName": "Group Manager",
  "description": "Can manage group memberships without accessing other directory settings.",
  "isEnabled": true,
  "rolePermissions": [
    {
      "allowedResourceActions": [
        "microsoft.directory/groups/members/update",
        "microsoft.directory/groups/members/read"
      ],
      "excludedResourceActions": []
    }
  ],
  "assignableScopes": ["/"]
}
```

**Benefits:**

- **Tailored Administrative Access:** Grant specific administrative permissions without broader directory controls.
- **Improved Security:** Limit the scope of administrative actions to reduce potential security risks.
- **Operational Efficiency:** Streamline administrative tasks by delegating precise responsibilities.

### Use Cases for Azure Entra ID Roles

- **Directory Management:** Assign Global Administrators to manage all aspects of Entra ID.
- **User Management:** Assign User Administrators to handle user accounts and group memberships.
- **Security Oversight:** Assign Security Administrators to manage security policies and monitor threats.
- **Application Management:** Assign Application Administrators to handle app registrations and integrations.

### Notes

- Entra ID Custom Roles require Entra ID Premium P1 licensing at least
- Using Powershell or the MS Graph API provides more control over the role definition.
