## How VPN server works ?

**VPN server acts as an a router between your public IP address and the internet.**

+ When you use a VPN server, your actual public IP address is hidden, and the only public IP address visible to the internet is that of the VPN serve
+ the VPN server is responsible for routing and forwarding your data to its intended destination on the internet. Websites and online services see the VPN server's IP address as the source of the communication, not your actual IP address.
+ Since you connect through a VPN server, it appears as though you are accessing the internet from the location of the server.
