# WSL 2 Networking

WSL 2 (Windows Subsystem for Linux 2) operates differently compared to traditional VMs like those managed by Hyper-V or VirtualBox. Here's a detailed breakdown of how WSL 2 handles networking and how multiple distributions interact with the system:

## Key Points about WSL 2 Networking:

1. **Lightweight VM:**

   - WSL 2 runs each Linux distribution inside a lightweight virtual machine managed by a Windows Hyper-V utility. This makes it more efficient than a traditional VM but still separate from the host OS.

2. **Multiple Distributions:**

   - You can install and run multiple Linux distributions simultaneously within WSL 2. Each distribution can have a different filesystem and configuration.

3. **Shared IP Address:**

   - All running WSL 2 distributions share the same IP address, which is assigned to the WSL 2 VM by the host system. This IP address is part of a virtual network that WSL 2 creates on the host machine.
   - The WSL 2 VM gets its IP address from a DHCP server provided by Windows, and all distributions share this network interface. Therefore, they appear to have the same IP address when checked from within WSL 2.

4. **Network Connectivity:**

   - WSL 2 distributions can connect to the host's network interface (NIC). This allows WSL 2 distributions to access external networks (like the internet) and communicate with the host system.
   - Communication between WSL 2 distributions, the host, and external networks is handled through this shared network interface.

5. **Virtual Ethernet Adapter:**
   - The host creates a virtual Ethernet adapter for WSL 2, which bridges the virtual network used by the WSL 2 VM with the host's physical network. This adapter facilitates the shared IP address and network connectivity.

## WSL 2 Networking Details:

1. **Network Interfaces:**

   - WSL 2 distributions use a virtual network interface (`eth0`) for networking. This interface is bridged to the host's network adapter.
   - When you run `ip addr show eth0` in different WSL 2 distributions, you will see the same IP address for all distributions because they share the same virtual network.

2. **Host Connectivity:**

   - WSL 2 distributions can communicate with the host system using the IP address of the virtual adapter. For example, you can access services running on Windows from WSL 2 using the host's IP address.

3. **External Connectivity:**
   - WSL 2 can access the internet and external networks through the host's network adapter. The virtual network adapter routes traffic between the WSL 2 VM and the external network.

## Conclusion

- **WSL 2 is a lightweight VM:**

  - It allows multiple Linux distributions to run simultaneously.
  - Each distribution can have a different filesystem and configuration.

- **Shared IP Address:**

  - All distributions running within WSL 2 share the same IP address assigned to the WSL 2 VM by the host system.
  - This shared IP address is managed by a virtual network created by WSL 2 on the host machine.

- **Network Connectivity:**
  - WSL 2 distributions can connect to the host's NIC and access external networks.
  - Communication between WSL 2 distributions and the host is facilitated through the virtual network adapter.

## Limitations

- **Lack of Network Isolation:**
  - Unlike traditional VMs, WSL 2 does not provide separate IP addresses for each distribution by default, which limits network isolation.
  - For advanced network configurations and control, traditional virtualization tools like Hyper-V, VirtualBox, or Docker Desktop might be more suitable.

By understanding these details, you can better manage and utilize WSL 2's networking capabilities, while also recognizing its limitations compared to traditional virtualization tools.

## WSL2 Tips & Tricks

### **1.Change Username of WSL2 Distro**

```powershell
wsl -l -v
# 1.temporarily change it to login as root (run this in powershell)
[distro-name] config --default-user root
```

```bash
# 2.Start WSL and "rename the user while running as root"
usermod -l newuser -d /home/newuser -m olduser
```

```powershell
# 3.adjust the config to login as the updated account (again in powershell)
[distro-name]  config --default-user newuser
```

### **2.Changing the Username**

- **PowerShell Method**:

  ```powershell
  wsl -u <username>
  ```

- **wsl.conf Method**:

  - Edit or create `/etc/wsl.conf`:

    ```bash
    [user]
    default=<username>
    ```

### **3.Moving a WSL Distro to Another Drive**

- **Export**:

  ```powershell
  wsl --export <distro> <path>
  ```

- **Unregister**:

  ```powershell
  wsl --unregister <distro>
  ```

- **Import**:

  ```powershell
  wsl --import <distro> <new path> <file>
  ```

### **4.Increasing WSL2 Disk Capacity**

- **Shutdown WSL**:

  ```powershell
  wsl --shutdown
  ```

- **Resize Disk**:

  ```powershell
  diskpart
  ```

  - Inside diskpart:

    ```powershell
    select vdisk file="<path>"
    expand vdisk maximum=<size_in_MB>
    attach vdisk
    list volume
    select volume <number>
    extend
    exit
    ```

- **Inside WSL**:

  ```bash
  resize2fs /dev/sdXn
  ```

### **5.Changing Directory Ownership and Permissions**

- **Change Ownership**:

  ```bash
  sudo chown -R <username>:<group> <directory>
  ```

- **Change Permissions**:

  ```bash
  sudo chmod -R <permissions> <directory>
  ```

### **6.Uninstalling a WSL Distro**

- **Unregister**:

  ```powershell
  wsl --unregister <distro>
  ```
