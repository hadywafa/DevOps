# IP-in-IP Protocol

**IP-in-IP** is a network protocol used to encapsulate one IP packet within another IP packet. This encapsulation is typically used to create a tunnel between two networks or devices, allowing the inner IP packet to be transported over an intermediate network.

## **Key Points About IP-in-IP:**

- **Purpose:** IP-in-IP is used for creating tunnels, where one IP packet (the inner packet) is encapsulated within another IP packet (the outer packet). This is often done to route packets through a network that may not support the original packetâ€™s protocol or to connect isolated networks.

- **How It Works:**

  - **Encapsulation:** An IP packet is encapsulated with a new IP header. The outer IP header contains routing information for the packet to travel through the network, while the inner IP packet remains unchanged and carries its own routing information.
  - **Decapsulation:** At the destination, the outer IP header is removed, and the inner IP packet is extracted and processed as if it had been sent directly.

- **Uses:**

  - **Tunneling:** Used to tunnel traffic through a network that may not support the original traffic type or to connect different networks over an intermediate network.
  - **Network Isolation:** Helps in isolating and protecting network traffic by encapsulating it within another IP packet.

- **Comparison with Other Tunneling Methods:**
  - IP-in-IP is a basic form of tunneling compared to more advanced protocols like GRE (Generic Routing Encapsulation) or IPsec, which offer additional features such as encryption and more complex encapsulation.

## **Summary:**

IP-in-IP is a protocol for encapsulating one IP packet inside another IP packet. It is used to create tunnels and transport packets through intermediate networks, often for connecting isolated networks or handling network traffic that requires specific routing.
