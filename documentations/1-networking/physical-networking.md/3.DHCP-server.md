# DHCP Server and IP Address Assignment

**Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP)** is used to automatically assign IP addresses and other network configuration parameters to devices on a network. Here’s how it works, particularly in the context of virtual machines (VMs) on a Bridged Adapter network:

## What is a DHCP Server?

- **Definition:** A DHCP server is a network service that automatically assigns IP addresses and other network configuration settings to devices on the network.
- **Location:** It can be on various devices:
  - **Router:** Commonly, home and office routers include a built-in DHCP server.
  - **Dedicated Server:** In larger networks, a dedicated server may run DHCP services.

## DHCP Server and VMs in Bridged Adapter Mode

### **How Does the DHCP Server Assign an IP Address to a VM ?**

1. **VM Initialization:**

   - When a VM is powered on and configured to use Bridged Adapter mode, it connects to the physical network through the host’s network interface card (NIC).

2. **DHCP Discover:**

   - The VM's virtual network adapter sends out a DHCP Discover message on the network. This message is a broadcast packet asking for network configuration information.

3. **Broadcast Communication:**

   - Since the VM is in Bridged Adapter mode, it acts like any other device on the physical network. Its network traffic is broadcast on the same network segment as other devices.
   - The DHCP Discover message is broadcasted to all devices on the network, including the DHCP server.

4. **DHCP Offer:**

   - The DHCP server (located on the router or a dedicated server on the network) receives the DHCP Discover message and responds with a DHCP Offer message.
   - This offer includes an IP address (e.g., `192.168.0.5`), subnet mask, gateway, DNS server, and lease duration.

5. **DHCP Request:**

   - The VM receives the DHCP Offer and sends a DHCP Request message back to the DHCP server, indicating that it accepts the offer.

6. **DHCP Acknowledgment:**

   - The DHCP server responds with a DHCP Acknowledgment message, confirming that the VM has been assigned the IP address `192.168.0.5` and providing other configuration details.

7. **Configuration:**
   - The VM configures its network interface with the assigned IP address and other network settings.

### **How the DHCP Server Sees the VM ?**

- **Network Visibility:**

  - In Bridged Adapter mode, the VM is visible to the DHCP server just like any physical device on the network. It appears with its own unique MAC address, which is assigned by the VM’s virtual network adapter.

- **MAC Address and IP Mapping:**
  - The DHCP server uses the VM's MAC address (sent in the DHCP Discover message) to assign an IP address. It maintains a mapping of MAC addresses to IP addresses in its DHCP lease table.

### **Example Scenario:**

1. **Network Setup:**

   - A physical network with a router (192.168.0.1) and a DHCP server (often integrated into the router).

2. **VM Configuration:**

   - VM is set to use Bridged Adapter mode and boots up.

3. **DHCP Process:**
   - The VM sends a DHCP Discover message to the network.
   - The DHCP server on the router receives this message and offers an IP address (e.g., `192.168.0.5`).
   - The VM accepts the offer and configures its network interface with the assigned IP address.

## Summary

- **DHCP Server:** A service that automatically assigns IP addresses and network configuration settings.
- **Location:** It can be a router or a dedicated server on the network.
- **Process:** The VM sends a DHCP Discover message, and the DHCP server responds with an offer, which the VM accepts.

In Bridged Adapter mode, the VM acts as if it is a physical device on the network, receiving its IP address from the same DHCP server that serves other devices.
