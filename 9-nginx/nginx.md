# NGINX

## Definition

[NGINX](https://nginx.org/) is a high-performance, open-source web server and reverse proxy server. It is known for its efficiency, scalability, and ability to handle concurrent connections efficiently. Originally designed to address the C10k problem (supporting thousands of concurrent connections), NGINX has evolved into a versatile solution for various web serving and proxying needs.

## Key Features

- **Web Server:** NGINX can serve static content directly and act as a reverse proxy for dynamic content, enhancing web server performance.

- **Reverse Proxy:** NGINX can act as a reverse proxy, forwarding requests to other servers and returning the responses to clients. This is often used to improve security, load balance, and cache content.

- **Load Balancer:** NGINX can distribute incoming network traffic across multiple servers, ensuring optimal resource utilization and improved fault tolerance.

- **HTTP and HTTPS:** NGINX supports both HTTP and HTTPS protocols, providing secure communication over the internet.

- **Efficiency:** NGINX is known for its low resource usage and high performance, making it suitable for serving static content and handling a large number of simultaneous connections.

- **Proxy Caching:** NGINX can cache static content and serve it directly to clients, reducing the load on backend servers and improving response times.

- **Modules and Extensibility:** NGINX is highly extensible through modules, allowing users to add or customize features based on their requirements.

- **Community and Support:** NGINX has a large and active community that contributes to its development and provides support through forums, documentation, and third-party modules.

NGINX is widely used as a web server, reverse proxy, and load balancer in various deployment scenarios, ranging from small websites to large-scale, high-traffic platforms.

## `NGINX` vs `IIS` vs `Kestrel`

| Feature                   | NGINX                                   | IIS                                   | Kestrel                               |
|---------------------------|-----------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|
| **Role**                   | Web server, reverse proxy, load balancer | Web server                            | Web server (specifically for ASP.NET Core) |
| **Architecture**           | Event-driven, asynchronous              | Modular, tightly integrated with Windows | Asynchronous (built on libuv library) |
| **Use Cases**              | Static content serving, reverse proxy, load balancing | Hosting ASP.NET applications, static websites, web services | Hosting ASP.NET Core applications, microservices |
| **Static vs. Dynamic**     | Excellent for serving static content, reverse proxy | Often used for hosting ASP.NET applications with dynamic content | Specifically designed for ASP.NET Core applications |
| **Operating System**       | Cross-platform                           | Windows                               | Cross-platform, benefits from a reverse proxy like NGINX in production |
| **Deployment Scenario**    | Commonly used as a reverse proxy in front of application servers | Primary web server for Windows environments | Typically used with a reverse proxy (e.g., NGINX) in production |
| **Community Support**      | Large and active community               | Strong Microsoft support and community | Supported by the ASP.NET team at Microsoft |
| **Extensions/Modules**      | Extensive plugin ecosystem               | Supports various modules and extensions | Minimalistic, often used with a reverse proxy for additional features |
| **Scalability**            | Efficient handling of concurrent connections | Scales well for Windows environments  | Designed for microservices and cloud-native applications |
