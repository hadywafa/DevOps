# Docker Compose

## definition

+ Docker Compose is a tool for defining and running multi-container Docker applications.
+ Docker Compose configurations are written in a YAML file called `docker-compose.yml`.
+ This file defines services, networks, and volumes used in your application.
+ With a single command, you can start all the services making it easy to manage and deploy complex applications with multiple interconnected containers.

## syntax

```yaml
version: '3'  # Docker Compose file format version

services:  # Define your services here
  web:
    image: nginx:latest  # Docker image to use
    ports:
      - "8080:80"  # Map host port 8080 to container port 80
    volumes:
      - ./nginx-conf:/etc/nginx/conf.d  # Mount a local directory to a container directory
    environment:
      - NGINX_HOST=example.com
      - NGINX_PORT=80

  app:
    image: my-app:latest  # Docker image for your application
    ports:
      - "5000:5000"
    depends_on:
      - db
    environment:
      - DATABASE_URL=postgres://dbuser:dbpassword@db:5432/mydatabase

  db:
    image: postgres:latest  # PostgreSQL database image
    environment:
      - POSTGRES_USER=dbuser
      - POSTGRES_PASSWORD=dbpassword
      - POSTGRES_DB=mydatabase

```
