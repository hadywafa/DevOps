## Docker Architecture

1. `Docker Engine`:-

    + Think of Docker Engine as the main superhero. It's the powerful force that manages everything related to containers.
    + Within the Docker Engine, there are two main components:
        + **Docker Daemon**: This is the superhero's brain and muscles. It does the heavy lifting, managing containers on the system.
        + **Docker Client**: This is like a magical remote control that you use to communicate with the superhero (Daemon). You press buttons on the remote to create, stop, or check on containers.

1. `Docker Images`:

    + Imagine Docker images as blueprints or recipes for your toys. These images contain all the instructions needed to create a container, specifying what the toy is, what it needs, and how it should behave.

1. `Docker Containers`:

    + Containers are like individual, isolated play areas for your toys. Each container is created from an image and provides a self-contained environment for the toy to play without interfering with other toys.

1. `Docker Registry`:

    + Picture a big library where people store and share their toy blueprints (images). This library is called a Docker Registry. When you want to share your favorite toy with others, you put the blueprint (image) in the library so they can use it too.

In summary, Docker Engine is the superhero managing containers, with a brain (Daemon) doing the heavy lifting. You use a magical remote control (Client) to give commands. The toys (your applications) live in containers, and their blueprints are stored in a big library (Registry) for sharing.

## Docker CLI

### `docker registry`

+ `login`
  + Allows you to log in to a Docker registry, providing credentials to access private repositories.
  + >docker login [OPTIONS] [SERVER]
  + > docker login registry.example.com

+ `logout`
  + Logs out from a Docker registry.
  + >docker logout [SERVER]
  + >docker logout registry.example.com

+ `inspect`
  + Provides detailed information about Docker objects, such as containers, images, networks, etc.
  + >docker inspect [OPTIONS] NAME|ID [NAME|ID...]
  + >docker inspect my_container

+ `ls`
  + Lists containers.
  + >docker ls [OPTIONS]
  + >docker ls

+ `Images`
  + Lists images on your local machine.
  + >docker images [OPTIONS] [REPOSITORY[:TAG]]
  + >docker images

+ `ps`
  + Lists running containers.
  + >docker ps [OPTIONS]
  + >docker ps

+ `version`
  + Shows the Docker version information.
  + >docker version [OPTIONS]
  + >docker version

### `docker image` / `docker`

+ `pull`
  + To download (pull) a Docker image from a registry
  + >docker pull nginx

+ `push`
  + To push a locally built or modified image to a container registry (like Docker Hub)
  + >docker push my-custom-image:1.0

+ `build`
  + To build a custom Docker image from a Dockerfile located in the current directory
  + >docker build -t my-custom-image

+ `rmi`
  + To remove a Docker image from your system
  + >docker rmi nginx

+ `prune`
  + to remove all unused (dangling) images from your system
  + >docker image prune

+ `tag`
  + To tag an image with a custom name and optional version
  + >docker tag nginx my-nginx:1.0

+ `search`
  + To search for Docker images on Docker Hub or other registries
  + >docker search ubuntu

+ `save`
  + You can save a Docker image to a tarball file and then load it back using the save and load commands
  + >docker save -o my-image.tar my-nginx:1.0
  + >docker load -i my-image.tar

+ `commit`
  + command provides a way to capture the current state of a container and save it as a new image.
  + >docker commit my_container my_new_image

### `docker container`

+ `create`
  + To create a container from image without starting it
  + >docker create -it --name <mycontainer_name> ubuntu
+ `start`
  + To start a stopped container
  + >docker start <container_id_or_name>
+ `run`
  + this command is equal to 3 command together:-
    1. docker image pull
    1. docker container create
    1. docker container start
  + >docker run -it ubuntu
  + >docker run -d nginx
+ `stop`
  + To stop a running container,
  + >docker stop <container_id_or_name>
+ `restart`
  + To restart a stopped or running container
  + >docker restart <container_id_or_name>
+ `rm`
  + To remove a stopped container
  + >docker rm <container_id_or_name>
+ `exce`
  + To execute a command in a running container
  + >docker exec -it <container_id_or_name> /bin/bash
+ `logs`
  + To view the logs of a running container, use the **logs** command:
  + >docker logs <container_id_or_name>
+ `inspect`
  + To view detailed information about a container, including its configuration.
  + >docker inspect <container_id_or_name>

### `docker network`

+ `ls`
  + Lists all Docker networks on the host.
  + >docker network ls

+ `drivers`
  + Lists all network drivers available on the Docker host.
  + >docker network drivers

+ `inspect`
  + Provides detailed information about a specific Docker network.
  + >docker network inspect [NETWORK_NAME]

+ `create`
  + Creates a new Docker network.
  + >docker network create [OPTIONS] [NETWORK_NAME]
  + >docker network create --driver bridge my_bridge_network

+ `rm`
  + Deletes a Docker network.
  + >docker network rm [NETWORK_NAME]

+ `connect`
  + Connects a running container to a specified Docker network.
  + >docker network connect [NETWORK_NAME] [CONTAINER_NAME]
  + >docker network connect my_bridge_network my_container

+ `disconnect`
  + Disconnects a running container from a specified Docker network.
  + >docker network disconnect [NETWORK_NAME] [CONTAINER_NAME]
  + >docker network disconnect my_bridge_network my_container

+ `prune`
  + Removes all unused networks.
  + >docker network prune
