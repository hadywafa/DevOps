### `CMD`

+ Specifies the default command to run when the container starts.

### `EXPOSE`

## Examples Dockerfile

### Example 1

```docker
# Use an official Node.js runtime as a parent image
FROM node:14

# Set the working directory to /app
WORKDIR /app

# Copy package.json and package-lock.json to the working directory
COPY package*.json ./

# Install app dependencies
RUN npm install

# Copy the current directory contents into the container at /app
COPY . .

# Expose port 3000
EXPOSE 3000

# Define the command to run the application
CMD ["node", "app.js"]

```

### Example 2

```docker
# Use the official .NET Core SDK as a build image
FROM mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/sdk:3.1 AS build

WORKDIR /app

# Copy only the project file to leverage Docker cache
COPY *.csproj ./

# Restore dependencies
RUN dotnet restore

# Copy the rest of the application code
COPY . .

# Build the application
RUN dotnet publish -c Release -o out

# Use the official .NET Core runtime as a runtime image
FROM mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/aspnet:3.1 AS runtime

WORKDIR /app

# Copy the published output from the build image
COPY --from=build /app/out .

# Expose port 80
EXPOSE 80

# Define the entry point for the application
ENTRYPOINT ["dotnet", "YourApiName.dll"]

```

## Notes

### How to Build docker image from DockerFile

docker image build -t <image-name>
```

### How to create new image from changes in running container

```docker commit <container-name> <new-image-name>
docker
```
