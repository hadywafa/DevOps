# Notes

+ Container = App = first command (process) on that container
  + you can start container with different process
  + you can run many process in same container
  + first process will have id = 1
  + if you terminate the main process then the container will be terminated too

+ image_name can be :-
  + `<official_repo> :  <tag>`
    + python:3.10
    + ubuntu:20.04
    + postgres:latest
    + postgres
  + `<account_name>/<non_official_repo> : <tag>`
    + hadywafa/team-hub:v1

+ you can't remove running container
+ you can't remove image that is used by running container.

+ some Docker commands can be used without the word "image" when working with images. Docker provides a simplified syntax for many image-related commands. Here are those commands with the simplified syntax:
  + List Images:
    + docker images
    + docker image ls
  + Remove an Image:
    + docker rmi nginx
    + docker image rm nginx
  + Remove All Unused Images:
    + docker image prune
  + Inspect an Image:
    + docker image inspect nginx
  + Tag an Image:
    + docker tag nginx my-nginx:1.0
    + docker image tag nginx my-nginx:1.0
  + Build an Image from a Dockerfile:
    + docker build -t my-custom-image
  + Save and Load Images:
    + docker save -o my-image.tar my-nginx:1.0
    + docker load -i my-image.tar
  + History of an Image:
    + docker history my-nginx:1.0

+ any image is readonly
