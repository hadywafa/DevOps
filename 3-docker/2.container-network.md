### Types

1. `Bridge`
    + **Function**: Creates a network bridge on the host and attaches containers to it.
    + **Use Case**: Suitable for simple, flat networks where containers on the same host need to communicate.

1. `Macvlan`
    + **Function**: Assigns a MAC address to each container, making them appear as physical devices on the network.
    + **Use Case**: Useful when containers need to be part of a physical network, often used in more complex setups.

1. `IPVlan`
    + **Function**: Similar to Macvlan but uses IP addresses instead of MAC addresses.
    + **Use Case**: Efficient for high-density environments, as it reduces broadcast traffic.

1. `Host-local`
    + **Function**: A simple IP address management (IPAM) plugin that assigns IP addresses from pre-defined ranges.
    + **Use Case**: Commonly used in conjunction with other plugins for basic IP address management.

1. `DHCP`
    + **Function**: Leverages external DHCP server to allocate IP addresses.
    + **Use Case**: Ideal in environments where DHCP is already used for IP management.
