# Jenkins

## What is Jenkins ?

[`Jenkins`](https://www.jenkins.io/) is an open-source automation server widely used for continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) in software development. It facilitates the automation of building, testing, and deploying applications, helping teams deliver high-quality software more efficiently.

### Key Features

- **Automation:** Jenkins automates repetitive tasks in the software development lifecycle.
  
- **Continuous Integration (CI):** Jenkins supports CI by automatically integrating code changes from multiple contributors into a shared repository.

- **Continuous Delivery (CD):** It extends CI to include continuous delivery, automating the deployment of applications to different environments.

- **Extensibility:** Jenkins has a vast ecosystem of plugins that enable integration with various tools and technologies.

- **Web-Based Interface:** Jenkins provides a web-based graphical user interface (GUI) for configuring and managing jobs and build pipelines.

- **Build Pipelines:** Users can define complex build and deployment pipelines using Jenkins.

- **Distributed Builds:** Jenkins supports the distribution of build and test workloads across multiple machines.

- **Wide Community Support:** Jenkins has a large and active community that contributes to its development and provides support.

Jenkins plays a crucial role in modern software development practices, promoting automation, collaboration, and faster delivery of high-quality software.
